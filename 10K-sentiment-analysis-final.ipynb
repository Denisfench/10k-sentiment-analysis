(AAG), a Delaware corporation, is a holding company and its principal, wholly-owned subsidiaries are American Airlines, Inc. (American), Envoy Aviation Group Inc. (Envoy), PSA Airlines, Inc. (PSA) and Piedmont Airlines, Inc. (Piedmont). AAG was formed in 1982 under the name AMR Corporation (AMR) as the parent company of American, which was founded in 1934. AAG’s and American’s principal executive offices are located at 1 Skyview Drive, Fort Worth, Texas 76155 and their telephone number is 817-963-1234.Airline OperationsOur primary business activity is the operation of a major network carrier, providing scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo.Together with our wholly-owned regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers operating as American Eagle, our airline operates an average of 6,800 flights per day to more than 365 destinations in 61 countries through our hubs and gateways in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, London Heathrow, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. In 2019, approximately 215 million passengers boarded our flights. During 2019, we launched new seasonal nonstop service to transatlantic markets Dubrovnik, Croatia and Berlin, Germany from Philadelphia International Airport (PHL). We also announced an international expansion beginning in summer 2020 that will, among other things, introduce new seasonal nonstop service between PHL and Casablanca, Morocco, representing our entry into the African market, new seasonal nonstop service between Chicago O’Hare International Airport (ORD) and Krakow, Poland, Prague, Czech Republic and Budapest, Hungary, and the return of service to Tel Aviv, Israel, with year-round nonstop service from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW). Beginning in October 2020, we also plan to operate new seasonal nonstop service between Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and Christchurch, New Zealand and from DFW to Auckland, New Zealand, to which we currently operate seasonal service from LAX. As of December\\xa031, 2019, we operated 942 mainline aircraft supported by our regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers, which operated an additional 605 regional aircraft. See Part I, Item 2. Properties for further discussion on our mainline and regional aircraft and “Regional” below for further discussion on our regional operations.American is a founding member of the oneworld® alliance, whose members serve 1,100 destinations in 180 countries and territories. See below for further discussion on the oneworld alliance and other agreements with domestic and international airlines.See Part II, Item\\xa07. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\\xa0–“2019 Financial Overview,” “AAG’s Results of Operations” and “American’s Results of Operations” for further discussion of AAG’s and American’s operating results and operating performance. Also, see Note 14 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item\\xa08A and Note 12 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item\\xa08B for information regarding operating segments and see Note 1(k) to each of AAG’s and American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Items 8A and 8B, respectively, for passenger revenue by geographic region. RegionalOur regional carriers provide scheduled air transportation under the brand name “American Eagle.” The American Eagle carriers include our wholly-owned regional carriers Envoy, PSA and Piedmont, as well as third-party regional carriers including Republic Airline Inc. (Republic), Mesa Airlines, Inc. (Mesa), SkyWest Airlines, Inc. (SkyWest) and Compass Airlines, LLC (Compass). Our regional carriers are an integral component of our operating network. We rely heavily on regional carriers to drive feeder traffic to our hubs from low-density markets that are not economical for us to serve with larger, mainline aircraft. In addition, regional carriers offer complementary service in many of our mainline markets. During 2019, approximately 59 million passengers boarded our regional carriers’ planes, approximately 43% of whom connected to or from our mainline flights. All American Eagle carriers use logos, service marks, aircraft paint schemes and uniforms similar to those of our mainline operations.5Substantially all of our regional carrier arrangements are in the form of capacity purchase agreements. The capacity purchase agreements provide that all revenues, including passenger, in-flight, ancillary, mail and freight revenues, go to us. We control marketing, scheduling, ticketing, pricing and seat inventories. In return, we agree to pay predetermined fees to these airlines for operating an agreed-upon number of aircraft, without regard to the number of passengers on board. In addition, these agreements provide that we either reimburse or pay 100% of certain variable costs, such as airport landing fees, fuel and passenger liability insurance. CargoOur cargo division provides a wide range of freight and mail services, with\\xa0facilities and interline connections available across the globe.Distribution and Marketing AgreementsPassengers can purchase tickets for travel on American through several distribution channels, including our website (www.aa.com), our mobile app, our reservations centers and third-party distribution channels, including those provided by or through global distribution systems (e.g., Amadeus, Sabre and Travelport), conventional travel agents, travel management companies and online travel agents (e.g., Expedia, including its booking sites Orbitz and Travelocity, and Booking Holdings, including its booking sites Kayak and Priceline). To remain competitive, we will need to manage our distribution costs and rights effectively, increase our distribution flexibility and improve the functionality of our proprietary and third-party distribution channels, while maintaining an industry-competitive cost structure. For more discussion, see Part I, Item\\xa01A. Risk Factors\\xa0– “We rely on third-party distribution channels and must manage effectively the costs, rights and functionality of these channels.”In general, beyond nonstop city pairs, carriers that have the greatest ability to seamlessly connect passengers to and from markets have a competitive advantage. In some cases, however, foreign governments limit U.S. air carriers’ rights to transport passengers beyond designated gateway cities in foreign countries. In order to improve access to domestic and foreign markets, we have arrangements with other airlines including through the oneworld alliance, other cooperation agreements, joint business agreements (JBAs), and marketing relationships, as further discussed below.Member of oneworld AllianceAmerican is a founding member of the oneworld alliance, which currently includes British Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways, Finnair, Iberia, Japan Airlines, LATAM Airlines Group, Malaysia Airlines, Qantas Airways, Qatar Airways, Royal Jordanian, S7 Airlines and SriLankan Airlines. The oneworld alliance links the networks of the member carriers and their respective affiliates to enhance customer service and smooth connections to the destinations served by the alliance, including linking the carriers’ loyalty programs and access to the carriers’ airport lounge facilities. Royal Air Maroc is expected to join the oneworld alliance in 2020. LATAM Airlines Group (LATAM) is in the process of withdrawing from the oneworld alliance, which is anticipated to be completed in the first half of 2020. Cooperation and Joint Business AgreementsAmerican has established a transatlantic JBA with British Airways, Iberia and Finnair, a transpacific JBA with Japan Airlines and a JBA relating to Australia and New Zealand with Qantas Airways, each of which has been granted antitrust immunity. Joint business agreements enable the carriers party to the relevant agreement to cooperate on flights between particular destinations and allow pooling and sharing of certain revenues and costs, enhanced loyalty program reciprocity and cooperation in other areas. American and its joint business partners received regulatory approval to enter into these JBAs and cooperation agreements. Joint business agreements have become a common approach among major carriers to address key regulatory restrictions typically applicable to international airline service, including limitations on the foreign ownership of airlines and national laws prohibiting foreign airlines from carrying passengers beyond specific gateway cities. Our competitors, including Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, are party to similar arrangements.The business relationship under the transatlantic JBA benefits from a grant of antitrust immunity from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and was reviewed by the European Commission (EC) in July 2010. In connection with this review, we provided certain commitments to the EC regarding, among other things, the availability of take-off and landing slots at London Heathrow (LHR) or London Gatwick (LGW) airports. The commitments accepted by the EC are binding for 10 years. In October 2018, in anticipation of the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (EU), commonly referred to as Brexit, and the expiry of the EC commitments in July 2020, the United Kingdom Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) opened an investigation into the transatlantic JBA. We continue to fully cooperate with the CMA. An application for antitrust immunity is also pending with the DOT to add Aer Lingus, which is owned by the parent company of British Airways and Iberia, to the transatlantic JBA.  6As announced in September 2019, we are in the process of unwinding our commercial relationship with LATAM. We do not expect this change to have a significant financial impact on our company. After giving effect to this change, American remains the largest U.S. carrier to Latin America.Marketing RelationshipsTo improve access to each other’s markets, various U.S. and foreign air carriers, including American, have established marketing agreements with other airlines. These marketing agreements generally provide enhanced customer choice by means of an expanded network with reciprocal loyalty program participation and joint sales cooperation. As of December\\xa031, 2019, American had codeshare and/or loyalty program relationships with Air Tahiti Nui, Alaska Airlines, British Airways, Cape Air, Cathay Dragon, Cathay Pacific, China Southern Airlines, EL AL, Etihad Airways, Fiji Airways, Finnair, Gulf Air, Hawaiian Airlines, Iberia, Interjet, Japan Airlines, Jetstar Group (includes Jetstar Airways and Jetstar Japan), Korean Air, LATAM (includes LATAM Airlines, LATAM Argentina, LATAM Brasil, LATAM Peru, LATAM Colombia and LATAM Ecuador), Malaysia Airlines, Qantas Airways, Qatar Airways, Royal Air Maroc, Royal Jordanian, S7 Airlines, Seaborne Airlines, SriLankan Airlines and Vueling Airlines. In February 2020, American announced that it intends to enter into a codeshare relationship with the Brazilian airline, GOL Linhas Aéreas, which is expected to be implemented in 2020, subject to the receipt of relevant government approvals. Recent DevelopmentsOn February 13, 2020, we announced our intention to enter into an expanded relationship with Alaska Airlines. This arrangement, once finalized, will expand our existing codeshare relationship, including codeshare on certain of our international routes from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) and LAX, and will provide for reciprocal loyalty program benefits and shared lounge access. In addition, we announced new nonstop international service from SEA to Bangalore, India and to LHR, expected to commence in October 2020 and March 2021, respectively. The implementation of this expanded relationship and commencement of these new routes are subject to the negotiation and execution of definitive documentation and governmental review.Loyalty ProgramOur loyalty program, AAdvantage®, was established to develop passenger loyalty by offering awards to travelers for their continued patronage. AAdvantage was named Best Elite Program in the Americas for the eighth consecutive year in that category at the 2019 Freddie Awards, which are annual awards that recognize the world’s most outstanding frequent travel programs. AAdvantage members earn mileage credits by flying on American, any oneworld airline or other partner airlines, or by using the services of over 1,000 program participants, such as the Citi and Barclaycard US co-branded credit cards, and certain hotels and car rental companies. For every dollar spent, non-status members earn five mileage credits, but Gold, Platinum, Platinum Pro and Executive Platinum status holders earn bonus mileage credits of seven, eight, nine and eleven mileage credits, respectively.All travel on eligible tickets counts toward qualification for elite status in the AAdvantage program. Mileage credits can be redeemed for free or upgraded travel on American and participating airlines, membership to our Admirals Club® or for other non-travel awards from our program participants. Most travel awards are subject to capacity-controlled seating. A member’s mileage credit does not expire as long as that member has any type of qualifying activity at least once every 18 months. Elite members can enjoy additional benefits of the AAdvantage program, including complimentary upgrades, checked bags, and Preferred and Main Cabin Extra seats, as well as priority check-in, security, boarding and baggage delivery. Additionally, our members earn bonus mileage credits when elite status is obtained. Under our agreements with AAdvantage members and program partners, we reserve the right to change the terms of the AAdvantage program at any time and without notice, and may end the program with six months’ notice. Program rules, partners, special offers, awards and requisite mileage levels for awards are subject to change.During 2019, our members redeemed approximately 14 million awards, including travel redemptions for flights and upgrades on American and other air carriers, as well as redemption of car and hotel awards, club memberships and merchandise. Approximately 8% of our 2019 total revenue passenger miles flown were from award travel.See Part II, Item\\xa07. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\\xa0– “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” for more information on our loyalty program.7Industry CompetitionDomesticThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive. On most of our domestic nonstop routes, we currently face competing service from other domestic airlines, including major network airlines, low-cost carriers and ultra-low-cost carriers such as Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines and United Airlines. Competition is even greater between cities that require a connection, where the major airlines compete via their respective hubs. In addition, we face competition on some of our connecting routes from airlines operating point-to-point service on such routes. We also compete with all-cargo and charter airlines and, particularly on shorter segments, ground and rail transportation.On all of our routes, pricing decisions are affected, in large part, by the need to meet competition from other airlines. Price competition occurs on a market-by-market basis through price discounts, changes in pricing structures, fare matching, targeted promotions and loyalty program initiatives. Airlines typically use discounted fares and other promotions to stimulate traffic during normally slack travel periods, when they begin service to new cities or when they have excess capacity, to generate cash flow, to maximize revenue per available seat mile and to establish, increase or preserve market share. Most airlines will quickly match price reductions in a particular market, and we have often elected to match discounted or promotional fares initiated by other air carriers in certain markets in order to compete in those markets.  In addition, low-fare, low-cost carriers, such as Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways, and so-called ultra-low-cost carriers, such as Allegiant Air, Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines, compete in many of the markets in which we operate and competition from these carriers is increasing.In addition to price competition, airlines compete for market share by increasing the size of their route system and the number of markets they serve. The American Eagle regional carriers increase the number of markets we serve by flying to lower demand markets and providing connections at our hubs. Many of our competitors also own or have agreements with regional airlines that provide similar services at their hubs and other locations. We also compete on the basis of scheduling (frequency and flight times), availability of nonstop flights, on-time performance, type of equipment, cabin configuration, amenities provided to passengers, loyalty programs, the automation of travel agent reservation systems, onboard products and other services. InternationalIn addition to our extensive domestic service, we provide international service to Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, Central and South America, Asia, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and in 2020, will expand our international service to include Israel as well as Morocco, our first African destination. In providing international air transportation, we compete with other U.S. airlines, foreign investor-owned airlines and foreign state-owned or state-affiliated airlines. Competition is increasing from foreign state-owned and state-affiliated airlines in the Gulf region, including Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways. These carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft in service and on order and are increasing service to the U.S. from locations both in and outside the Middle East. Service to and from locations outside of the Middle East is provided by some of these carriers under so-called “fifth freedom” rights permitted under international treaties which allow service to and from stopover points between an airline’s home country and the ultimate destination. Such flights, such as a stopover in Europe on flights to the United States, allow the carrier to sell tickets for travel between the stopover point and the United States in competition with service provided by us. We believe these state-owned and state-affiliated carriers in the Gulf region, including their affiliated carriers, benefit from significant government subsidies, which have allowed them to grow quickly, reinvest in their product and expand their global presence. Competition is also increasing from low-cost airlines executing international long-haul expansion strategies.In order to increase our ability to compete for international air transportation service, which is subject to extensive government regulation, U.S. and foreign carriers have entered into bilateral and multilateral marketing relationships, alliances, cooperation agreements and JBAs to exchange traffic among each other’s flights and route networks. See “Distribution and Marketing Agreements” above for further discussion.8Employees and Labor RelationsThe airline business is labor intensive.\\xa0In 2019, salaries, wages and benefits were our largest expense and represented 34% of our total operating expenses. As of December\\xa031, 2019, we had approximately 133,700 active full-time equivalent employees, approximately 85% of whom were represented by various labor unions responsible for negotiating the collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) covering them.Labor relations in the air transportation industry are regulated under the Railway Labor Act (RLA), which vests in the National Mediation Board (NMB) certain functions with respect to disputes between airlines and labor unions relating to union representation and CBAs. When an RLA CBA becomes amendable, if either party to the agreement wishes to modify its terms, it must notify the other party in the manner prescribed under the RLA and as agreed by the parties. Under the RLA, the parties must meet for direct negotiations, and, if no agreement is reached during direct negotiations between the parties, either party may request that the NMB appoint a federal mediator. The RLA prescribes no timetable for the direct negotiation and mediation processes, and it is not unusual for those processes to last for many months or even several years. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB in its discretion may declare that an impasse exists and proffer binding arbitration to the parties. Either party may decline to submit to arbitration and if arbitration is rejected by either party, a 30-day “cooling off” period commences. During or after that period, a Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) may be established, which examines the parties’ positions and recommends a solution. The PEB process lasts for 30 days and is followed by another 30-day “cooling off” period. At the end of this “cooling off” period, unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by Congress, the labor organization may exercise “self-help,” such as a strike, and the airline may resort to its own “self-help,” including the imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments to the CBA and the hiring of new employees to replace any striking workers.None of the unions representing our employees presently may lawfully engage in concerted slowdowns or refusals to work, such as strikes, sick-outs or other similar activity, against us. Nonetheless, there is a risk that employees, either with or without union involvement, could engage in one or more concerted refusals to work that could individually or collectively harm the operation of our airline and impair our financial performance.The following table shows our domestic airline employee groups that are represented by unions:Union\\xa0Class\\xa0or Craft\\xa0Employees (1)\\xa0ContractAmendable\\xa0DateMainline: \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Allied Pilots Association (APA)\\xa0Pilots\\xa013,800\\xa02020Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA)\\xa0Flight Attendants\\xa025,300\\xa02019Airline Customer Service Employee Association\\xa0– Communications Workers of America and International Brotherhood of Teamsters (CWA-IBT) \\xa0Passenger Service\\xa014,050\\xa02020Transport Workers Union and International Association of Machinists\\xa0& Aerospace Workers (TWU-IAM Association) \\xa0Mechanics and Related\\xa012,650\\xa02018TWU-IAM Association\\xa0Fleet Service\\xa017,750\\xa02018TWU-IAM Association\\xa0Stock Clerks\\xa01,850\\xa02018TWU-IAM Association\\xa0Flight Simulator Engineers\\xa0150\\xa02021TWU-IAM Association\\xa0Maintenance Control Technicians\\xa0200\\xa02018TWU-IAM Association\\xa0Maintenance Training Instructors\\xa030\\xa02018Professional Airline Flight Control Association (PAFCA)\\xa0Dispatchers\\xa0500\\xa02021Transport Workers Union (TWU)\\xa0Flight Crew Training Instructors\\xa0350\\xa02021Envoy: \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Air Line Pilots Associations (ALPA)\\xa0Pilots\\xa02,250\\xa02024Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA)\\xa0Flight Attendants\\xa01,650\\xa02020TWU\\xa0Ground School Instructors\\xa010\\xa02023TWU\\xa0Mechanics and Related\\xa01,400\\xa020209Union\\xa0Class\\xa0or Craft\\xa0Employees (1)\\xa0ContractAmendable\\xa0DateTWU\\xa0Stock Clerks\\xa0150\\xa02020TWU\\xa0Fleet Service Clerks\\xa04,050\\xa02019TWU\\xa0Dispatchers\\xa070\\xa02025Communications Workers of America (CWA)\\xa0Passenger Service\\xa06,300\\xa02026Piedmont: \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0ALPA\\xa0Pilots\\xa0550\\xa02024AFA\\xa0Flight Attendants\\xa0350\\xa02019International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT)\\xa0Mechanics\\xa0450\\xa02021IBT\\xa0Stock Clerks\\xa060\\xa02021CWA\\xa0Fleet and Passenger Service\\xa06,550\\xa02023IBT\\xa0Dispatchers\\xa030\\xa02019ALPA\\xa0Flight Crew Training Instructors\\xa040\\xa02024PSA: \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0ALPA\\xa0Pilots\\xa01,950\\xa02023AFA\\xa0Flight Attendants\\xa01,450\\xa02023International Association of Machinists\\xa0& Aerospace Workers (IAM)\\xa0Mechanics\\xa0700\\xa02022TWU\\xa0Dispatchers\\xa060\\xa02022\\xa0(1)\\xa0Approximate number of active employees represented as of December\\xa031, 2019.Joint collective bargaining agreements (JCBAs) have been reached with post-Merger employee groups, except for contracts with the TWU-IAM Association which represents the mechanics and related, fleet service, stock clerks, maintenance control technicians and maintenance training instructors whose contracts became amendable in the third quarter of 2018. Agreements in principle were reached with the TWU-IAM Association on January 30, 2020 for JCBAs covering all of these workgroups. Those agreements are subject to membership ratification vote. Additionally, the post-Merger JCBAs covering our pilots and flight attendants became amendable in January 2020 and December 2019, respectively. Negotiations continue for new agreements.Among our wholly-owned regional subsidiaries, the Envoy fleet service clerks, Piedmont flight attendants and Piedmont dispatchers have agreements that are now amendable and are engaged in traditional RLA negotiations. Envoy is also in negotiations with the union representing its flight attendants, whose contract becomes amendable in 2020.For more discussion, see Part I, Item\\xa01A. Risk Factors\\xa0– “Union disputes, employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions, or our inability to otherwise maintain labor costs at competitive levels may adversely affect our operations and financial performance.”Aircraft FuelOur operations and financial results are significantly affected by the availability and price of aircraft fuel, which in 2019 was our second largest expense. Based on our 2020 forecasted mainline and regional fuel consumption, we estimate that a one cent per gallon increase in the price of aircraft fuel would increase our 2020 annual fuel expense by $47 million.The following table shows annual aircraft fuel consumption and costs, including taxes, for our mainline and regional operations for 2019 and 2018 (gallons and aircraft fuel expense in millions).YearGallons\\xa0Average\\xa0 Priceper Gallon\\xa0Aircraft\\xa0 FuelExpense\\xa0Percent\\xa0of\\xa0TotalOperating Expenses20194,537\\xa0$2.07\\xa0$9,395\\xa022.0%20184,447\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02.23\\xa0\\xa0\\xa09,896\\xa023.6%10As of December\\xa031, 2019, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding to hedge our fuel consumption. As such, and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in aircraft fuel prices. Our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, although we review that policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors.Aircraft fuel prices have in the past, and may in the future, experience substantial volatility. We cannot predict the future availability, price volatility or cost of aircraft fuel. Natural disasters (including hurricanes or similar events in the U.S. Southeast and on the Gulf Coast where a significant portion of domestic refining capacity is located), political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, economic sanctions imposed against oil-producing countries or specific industry participants, changes in fuel-related governmental policy, the strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, changes in the cost to transport or store petroleum products, changes in access to petroleum product pipelines and terminals, speculation in the energy futures markets, changes in aircraft fuel production capacity or competing demand for fuel from other transport industries, such as maritime shipping, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages, distribution challenges, additional fuel price volatility and cost increases in the future. See Part I, Item\\xa01A. Risk Factors\\xa0– “Our business is very dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and liquidity.”Seasonality and Other FactorsDue to the greater demand for air travel during the summer months, revenues in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year tend to be greater than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year. General economic conditions, fears of terrorism or war, fare initiatives, fluctuations in fuel prices, labor actions, weather, natural disasters, outbreaks of disease and other factors could impact this seasonal pattern. Therefore, our quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of operating results for the entire year, and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.Domestic and Global Regulatory LandscapeGeneralAirlines are subject to extensive domestic and international regulatory requirements. Domestically, the DOT and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) exercise significant regulatory authority over air carriers.The DOT, among other things, oversees and regulates domestic and international codeshare agreements, international route authorities, competition and consumer protection matters such as advertising, denied boarding compensation and baggage liability. The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ), along with the DOT in certain instances, have jurisdiction over airline antitrust matters.The FAA similarly exercises safety oversight and regulates most operational matters of our business, including how we operate and maintain our aircraft. FAA requirements cover, among other things, required technology and necessary onboard equipment; systems, procedures and training necessary to ensure the continuous airworthiness of our fleet of aircraft; safety measures and equipment; crew scheduling limitations and experience requirements; and many other technical aspects of airline operations. Additionally, our pilots and other employees are subject to rigorous certification standards, and our pilots and other crew members must adhere to flight time and rest requirements. The FAA also controls the national airspace system, including operational rules and fees for air traffic control (ATC) services. The efficiency, reliability and capacity of the ATC network has a significant impact on our costs and on the timeliness of our operations.The U.S. Postal Service has jurisdiction over certain aspects of the transportation of mail and related services.Airport Access and OperationsDomestically, any U.S. airline authorized by the DOT is generally free to operate scheduled passenger service between any two points within the U.S. and its territories, with the exception of certain airports that require landing and take-off rights and authorizations (slots) and other facilities, and certain airports that impose geographic limitations on operations or curtail operations based on the time of day. Operations at three major domestic airports we serve (John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and La Guardia Airport (LGA) in New York City, and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) in Washington, D.C.) and many foreign airports we serve (including LHR) are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of slots or similar regulatory mechanisms that limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports. 11Each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period. In addition to slot restrictions, operations at LGA and DCA are also limited based on a so-called “perimeter rule” which generally limits the stage length of the flights that can be operated from those airports to 1,500 and 1,250 miles, respectively.Our ability to provide service can also be impaired at airports, such as ORD and LAX where the airport gate and other facilities are currently inadequate to accommodate all of the service that we would like to provide, or airports such as Dallas Love Field Airport where we have no access to gates at all.Existing law also permits domestic local airport authorities to implement procedures and impose restrictions designed to abate noise, provided such procedures and restrictions do not unreasonably interfere with interstate or foreign commerce or the national transportation system. In some instances, these restrictions have caused curtailments in service or increases in operating costs.Airline Fares, Taxes and User FeesAirlines are permitted to establish their own domestic fares without governmental regulation. The DOT maintains authority over certain international fares, rates and charges, but only applies this authority on a limited basis. In addition, international fares and rates are sometimes subject to the jurisdiction of the governments of the foreign countries which we serve.Airlines are obligated to collect a federal excise tax, commonly referred to as the “ticket tax,” on domestic and international air transportation, and to collect other taxes and charge other fees, such as foreign taxes, security fees and passenger facility charges. Although these taxes and fees are not our operating expenses, they represent an additional cost to our customers. These taxes and fees are subject to increase from time to time.DOT Passenger Protection RulesThe DOT regulates airline interactions with passengers through the ticketing process, at the airport and on board the aircraft. Among other things, these regulations govern how our fares are displayed online, required customer disclosures, access by disabled passengers, handling of long onboard flight delays and reporting of mishandled bags. In 2020, the DOT is expected to implement a number of new regulations that will impact us, including disability rules for accessible lavatories and refunds for checked bag fees in the event of certain delays in delivery.InternationalInternational air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation, including aviation agreements between the U.S. and other countries or governmental authorities, such as the EU. Moreover, our alliances with international carriers may be subject to the jurisdiction and regulations of various foreign agencies. The U.S. government has negotiated “open skies” agreements with many countries, which allow unrestricted route authority access between the U.S. and the foreign markets. While the U.S. has worked to increase the number of countries with which open skies agreements are in effect, a number of markets important to us, including China, do not have open skies agreements.In addition, foreign countries impose passenger protection rules, which are analogous to, and often meet or exceed the requirements of, the DOT passenger protection rules discussed above. In cases where these foreign requirements exceed the DOT rules, we may bear additional burdens and liabilities. Further, various foreign airport authorities impose noise restrictions at their local airports.SecuritySince shortly after the events of September\\xa011, 2001, substantially all aspects of civil aviation security in the U.S. or affecting U.S. carriers have been controlled or regulated by the federal government through the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). Requirements include flight deck security; carriage of federal air marshals at no charge; enhanced security screening of passengers, baggage, cargo, mail, employees and vendors; fingerprint-based background checks of all employees and vendor employees with access to secure areas of airports; and the provision of certain passenger data to the federal government and other international border security authorities, for security and immigration controls. Funding for the TSA is provided by a combination of air carrier fees, passenger fees and taxpayer funds. Customs and Border Protection, which, like the TSA, is part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), also promulgates requirements, performs services and collects fees that impact our provision of services. Additionally, we have at times found it necessary or desirable to make significant expenditures to comply with security-related requirements while seeking to reduce their impact on our customers, such as expenditures for automated security screening lines at airports. Our international service further requires us to comply with the civil aviation security regimes imposed at the foreign airports we serve. 12Environmental MattersEnvironmental RegulationThe airline industry is subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters in the U.S. and other countries. U.S. federal laws that have a particular impact on our operations include the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990, the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund Act). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other federal agencies have been authorized to promulgate regulations that have an impact on our operations. In addition to these federal activities, various states have been delegated certain authorities under the aforementioned federal statutes. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental laws and regulations which are similar to or stricter than federal requirements.Revised underground storage tank regulations issued by the EPA in 2015 have affected certain airport fuel hydrant systems, with modifications of such systems needed in order to comply with applicable portions of the revised regulations. In addition, related to the EPA and state regulations pertaining to storm water management, several U.S. airport authorities are actively engaged in efforts to limit discharges of deicing fluid into the environment, often by requiring airlines to participate in the building or reconfiguring of airport deicing facilities.The environmental laws to which we are subject include those related to responsibility for potential soil and groundwater contamination. We are conducting investigation and remediation activities to address soil and groundwater conditions at several sites, including airports and maintenance bases. We presently anticipate that the ongoing costs of such activities will not have a material impact on our operations. In addition, we have been named as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at certain Superfund sites. Our alleged volumetric contributions at such sites are relatively small in comparison to total contributions of all PRPs. Accordingly, we presently anticipate that any future payments of costs at such sites will not have a material impact on our operations.We employ an environmental management system that provides a systematic approach for compliance with environmental regulations and management of a broad range of issues including air emissions, hazardous waste disposal, underground tanks, and aircraft water quality. Aircraft Emissions and Climate Change RequirementsMany aspects of our operations are subject to a number of increasingly stringent environmental regulations and concerns about climate change and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. In particular, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is in the process of adopting rules that will require us to limit the CO2 emissions of a significant majority of our international flights to a baseline level equal to our 2019-2020 average emissions from such flights. In 2016, ICAO passed a resolution adopting the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), an international, market-based emissions offset program intended to achieve carbon-neutral growth in the international aviation sector after 2020. CORSIA is expected to be implemented in three phases: the Pilot Phase (from 2021 to 2023); the First Phase (from 2024 to 2027); and the Second Phase (from 2027 to 2035). American and the majority of other U.S. airlines currently report their CO2 emissions to the FAA in accordance with CORSIA requirements. It is expected that the FAA (with the support of Congress) will implement regulations to establish a carbon offset credit surrender mechanism and to provide for the oversight and compliance auditing of the CORSIA obligations of U.S. carriers, including American.To meet their obligations under CORSIA, airlines will have the option to increase the efficiency of their fleet, use sustainable or lower carbon aircraft fuel, or purchase carbon offset credits. At this time, the costs of complying with our future obligations under CORSIA are uncertain and cannot be fully predicted. For example, we will not directly control our CORSIA compliance costs during the CORSIA Pilot and First Phases because such phases include a sharing mechanism for the growth in emissions for the global aviation sector. In addition, and with respect to all phases of CORSIA including after 2027, there is uncertainty with respect to the future supply, demand and price of sustainable or lower carbon aircraft fuel, carbon offset credits and technologies that could allow airlines to reduce their emissions of CO2.13In the event that CORSIA does not come into force as expected, American and other airlines could become subject to an unpredictable and inconsistent array of national or regional emissions restrictions, creating a patchwork of complex regulatory requirements that will often affect global competitors differently and frequently offer no meaningful aviation environmental improvements. For example, a directive adopted in 2008 by the EU currently covers CO2 emissions from flights operating within the mostly European countries participating in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). The EU ETS does not apply to CO2 emissions from the vast majority of American flights serving EU countries because, in 2012, the EU agreed to suspend the application of its rules to international flights to pursue, instead, a global effort solely through ICAO.  The EU has extended the suspension of its rules to international flights through the end of 2023, contingent on the successful implementation of CORSIA. We have taken a number of actions that mitigate our GHG emissions and conserve fuel such as:•retiring older, less fuel-efficient aircraft and replacing them with new, more fuel-efficient aircraft, resulting in the youngest mainline fleet of any U.S. network carrier;•reducing fuel consumption through operational initiatives such as single-engine taxi and engine washing;•working with the FAA and vendors to facilitate efficient airspace procedures, which also reduces aircraft emissions;•updating our fleet with lightweight interiors including seats and furnishings and replacing existing cargo containers with lighter weight versions; •replacing older, inefficient ground support equipment with new, more fuel-efficient ground support equipment, including alternative-fuel and electric powered equipment;•purchasing renewable electricity to reduce indirect emissions associated with the production of the power we consume;•seeking certification of certain of our buildings to the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standard;•entering into discussions with potential vendors to explore potential production pathways for sustainable alternative aircraft fuel; and•collaborating with airports and other stakeholders to accelerate the introduction of sustainable or lower carbon fuels.For further information, see our annual Corporate Responsibility Report, available on our website at www.aa.com/CRR. None of the information or contents of our website is incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Impact of Regulatory Requirements on Our BusinessRegulatory requirements, including but not limited to those discussed above, affect operations and increase operating costs for the airline industry, including our airline subsidiaries, and future regulatory developments may continue to do the same in the future. See Part I, Item\\xa01A.

We caution the reader that these risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risks and uncertainties, nor can it assess the extent to which any of the risk factors below or any such new risks and uncertainties, or any combination thereof, may impact our business.The airline industry is intensely competitive and dynamic.Our competitors include other major domestic airlines and foreign, regional and new entrant airlines, as well as joint ventures formed by some of these airlines, many of which have more financial or other resources and/or lower cost structures than ours, as well as other forms of transportation, including rail and private automobiles. In many of our markets we compete with at least one low-cost carrier (including so-called ultra-low cost carriers). Our revenues are sensitive to the actions of other carriers in many areas including pricing, scheduling, capacity, amenities, loyalty benefits and promotions, which can have a substantial adverse impact not only on our revenues, but on overall industry revenues. These factors may become even more significant in periods when the industry experiences large losses, as airlines under financial stress, or in bankruptcy, may institute pricing structures intended to achieve near-term survival rather than long-term viability.Low-cost carriers (including so-called ultra-low-cost carriers) have a profound impact on industry revenues. Using the advantage of low unit costs, these carriers offer lower fares in order to shift demand from larger, more established airlines, and represent significant competitors, particularly for customers who fly infrequently, are price sensitive and therefore tend not to be loyal to any one particular carrier. A number of these low-cost carriers have announced growth strategies including commitments to acquire significant numbers of new aircraft for delivery in the next few years. These low-cost carriers are attempting to continue to increase their market share through growth and, potentially, consolidation, and are expected to continue to have an impact on our revenues and overall performance. We and several other large network carriers have implemented “Basic Economy” fares designed to more effectively compete against low-cost carriers, but we cannot predict whether these initiatives will be successful. While historically these carriers have provided competition in domestic markets, we have recently experienced new competition from low-cost carriers on international routes, including low-cost airlines executing international long-haul expansion strategies. The actions of existing or future low-cost carriers, including those described above, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.We provide air travel internationally, directly as well as through joint business, alliance, codeshare and similar arrangements to which we are a party. While our network is comprehensive, compared to some of our key global competitors, we generally have somewhat greater relative exposure to certain regions (for example, Latin America) and somewhat lower relative exposures to others (for example, China). Our financial performance relative to our key competitors will therefore be influenced significantly by macro-economic conditions in particular regions around the world and the relative exposure of our network to the markets in those regions. In providing international air transportation, we compete to provide scheduled passenger and cargo service between the U.S. and various overseas locations with U.S. airlines, foreign investor-owned airlines and foreign state-owned or state-affiliated airlines. Competition is increasing from foreign state-owned and state-affiliated airlines in the Gulf region, including Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways. These carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft in service and on order and are increasing service to the U.S. from locations both in and outside the Middle East. Service to and from locations outside of the Middle East is provided by some of these carriers under so-called “fifth freedom” rights permitted under international treaties which allow service to and from stopover points between an airline’s home country and the ultimate destination. Such flights, such as a stopover in Europe on flights to the United States, allow the carrier to sell tickets for travel between the stopover point and the United States in competition with service provided by us. We believe these state-owned and state-affiliated carriers in the Gulf region, including their affiliated carriers, benefit from significant government subsidies, which have allowed them to grow quickly, reinvest in their product and expand their global presence.Our international service exposes us to foreign economies and the potential for reduced demand when any foreign country we serve suffers adverse local economic conditions. In addition, open skies agreements, which are now in place with a substantial number of countries around the world, provide international airlines with open access to U.S. markets, potentially subjecting us to increased competition on our international routes. See also “Our business is subject to extensive government regulation, which may result in increases in our costs, disruptions to our operations, limits on our operating flexibility, reductions in the demand for air travel, and competitive disadvantages.”16Certain airline alliances, joint ventures and joint businesses have been, or may in the future be, granted immunity from antitrust regulations by governmental authorities for specific areas of cooperation, such as joint pricing decisions. To the extent alliances formed by our competitors can undertake activities that are not available to us, our ability to effectively compete may be hindered. Our ability to attract and retain customers is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to offer our customers convenient access to desired markets. Our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain or obtain alliance and marketing relationships with other air carriers in desired markets.American has established a transatlantic JBA with British Airways, Iberia and Finnair, a transpacific JBA with Japan Airlines and a JBA relating to Australia and New Zealand with Qantas Airways, each of which has been granted antitrust immunity. The transatlantic JBA relationship benefits from a grant of antitrust immunity from the DOT and was reviewed by the EC in July 2010. In connection with this review, we provided certain commitments to the EC regarding, among other things, the availability of take-off and landing slots at LHR or LGW airports. The commitments accepted by the EC are binding for 10 years. In October 2018, in anticipation of Brexit and the expiry of the EC commitments in July 2020, the CMA opened an investigation into the transatlantic JBA. We continue to fully cooperate with the CMA. An application for antitrust immunity is also pending with the DOT to add Aer Lingus, which is owned by the parent company of British Airways and Iberia, to the transatlantic JBA. The foregoing arrangements are important aspects of our international network and we are dependent on the performance and continued cooperation of the other airlines party to those agreements. No assurances can be given as to any benefits that we may derive from such arrangements or any other arrangements that may ultimately be implemented, or whether or not regulators will, or if granted continue to, approve or impose material conditions on our business activities.Additional mergers and other forms of industry consolidation, including antitrust immunity grants, may take place and may not involve us as a participant. Depending on which carriers combine and which assets, if any, are sold or otherwise transferred to other carriers in connection with any such combinations, our competitive position relative to the post-combination carriers or other carriers that acquire such assets could be harmed. In addition, as carriers combine through traditional mergers or antitrust immunity grants, their route networks will grow, and that growth will result in greater overlap with our network, which in turn could decrease our overall market share and revenues. Such consolidation is not limited to the U.S., but could include further consolidation among international carriers in Europe and elsewhere.Additionally, our AAdvantage loyalty program, which is an important element of our sales and marketing programs, faces significant and increasing competition from the loyalty programs offered by other travel companies, as well as from similar loyalty benefits offered by banks and other financial services companies. Competition among loyalty programs is intense regarding the rewards, fees, required usage, and other terms and conditions of these programs. These competitive factors affect our ability to attract and retain customers, increase usage of our loyalty program and maximize the revenue generated by our loyalty program.Downturns in economic conditions could adversely affect our business. Due to the discretionary nature of business and leisure travel spending and the highly competitive nature of the airline industry, our revenues are heavily influenced by the condition of the U.S. economy and economies in other regions of the world. Unfavorable conditions in these broader economies have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased passenger demand for air travel, changes in booking practices and related reactions by our competitors, all of which in turn have had, and may have in the future, a strong negative effect on our business. See also “The airline industry is intensely competitive and dynamic.” Our business has been and will continue to be affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, including global events that affect travel behavior, and our results of operations could be volatile and fluctuate due to seasonality. Our business, results of operations and financial condition have been and will continue to be affected by many changing economic and other conditions beyond our control, including, among others:•actual or potential changes in international, national, regional and local economic, business and financial conditions, including recession, inflation, higher interest rates, wars, terrorist attacks and political instability;•changes in consumer preferences, perceptions, spending patterns and demographic trends;•changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation, changes in airline alliance affiliations, and other factors;17•actual or potential disruptions to the ATC systems;•increases in costs of safety, security, and environmental measures;•outbreaks of diseases that affect travel behavior; and•weather and natural disasters, including increases in frequency, severity or duration of such disasters, and related costs caused by more severe weather due to climate change.In particular, an outbreak of a contagious disease such as the Ebola virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, H1N1 influenza virus, avian flu, Zika virus, coronavirus or any other similar illness, if it were to become associated with air travel or persist for an extended period, could materially affect the airline industry and us by reducing revenues and adversely impacting our operations and passengers’ travel behavior. For example, the coronavirus outbreak that originated in or around Wuhan, China in January 2020 has resulted in the widespread suspension of commercial air service to the region, including by American, as well as the imposition by the U.S. and other governments of significant restrictions on inbound travel from this region. Our suspension of service, which remains in place as of the date of this report, and the potential for a period of significantly reduced demand for travel has and will likely continue to result in significant lost revenue. As a result of these or other conditions beyond our control, our results of operations could be volatile and subject to rapid and unexpected change. In addition, due to generally weaker demand for air travel during the winter, our revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year could be weaker than revenues in the second and third quarters of the year.Our business is very dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and liquidity.Our operating results are materially impacted by changes in the availability, price volatility and cost of aircraft fuel, which represents one of the largest single cost items in our business. Market prices for aircraft fuel have fluctuated substantially over the past several years and prices continue to be highly volatile.Because of the amount of fuel needed to operate our business, even a relatively small increase or decrease in the price of fuel can have a material effect on our operating results and liquidity. Due to the competitive nature of the airline industry and unpredictability of the market for air travel, we can offer no assurance that we may be able to increase our fares, impose fuel surcharges or otherwise increase revenues or decrease other operating costs sufficiently to offset fuel price increases. Similarly, we cannot predict actions that may be taken by our competitors in response to changes in fuel prices.Although we are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel, we cannot predict the future availability, price volatility or cost of aircraft fuel. Natural disasters (including hurricanes or similar events in the U.S. Southeast and on the Gulf Coast where a significant portion of domestic refining capacity is located), political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, economic sanctions imposed against oil-producing countries or specific industry participants, changes in fuel-related governmental policy, the strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, changes in the cost to transport or store petroleum products, changes in access to petroleum product pipelines and terminals, speculation in the energy futures markets, changes in aircraft fuel production capacity, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in fuel supply shortages, distribution challenges, additional fuel price volatility and cost increases in the future. For instance, effective January 1, 2020, rules adopted by the International Maritime Organization restrict the sulfur content allowable in marine fuels from 3.5% to 0.5%, which is expected to cause increased demand by maritime shipping companies for low-sulfur fuel and potentially lead to increased costs of aircraft fuel. Any of these factors or events could cause a disruption in or increased demands on oil production, refinery operations, pipeline capacity or terminal access and possibly result in significant increases in the price of aircraft fuel and diminished availability of aircraft fuel supply.Our aviation fuel purchase contracts generally do not provide meaningful price protection against increases in fuel costs. Our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, although we review this policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors. Accordingly, as of December\\xa031, 2019, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding to hedge our fuel consumption. As such, and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – “Aircraft Fuel.”18Our high level of debt and other obligations may limit our ability to fund general corporate requirements and obtain additional financing, may limit our flexibility in responding to competitive developments and cause our business to be vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions.We have significant amounts of indebtedness and other obligations, including pension obligations, obligations to make future payments on flight equipment and property leases related to airport and other facilities, and substantial non-cancelable obligations under aircraft and related spare engine purchase agreements. Moreover, currently a substantial portion of our assets are pledged to secure our indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations, which are generally greater than the indebtedness and other obligations of our competitors, could have important consequences. For example, they:•may make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness;•may limit our ability to obtain additional funding for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, integration costs and general corporate purposes, and adversely affect the terms on which such funding can be obtained;•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness and other obligations, thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes;•make us more vulnerable to economic downturns, industry conditions and catastrophic external events, particularly relative to competitors with lower relative levels of financial leverage;•significantly constrain our ability to respond, or respond quickly, to unexpected disruptions in our own operations, the U.S. or global economies, or the businesses in which we operate, or to take advantage of opportunities that would improve our business, operations, or competitive position versus other airlines;•limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions;•contain covenants requiring us to maintain an aggregate of at least $2.0\\xa0billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and amounts available to be drawn under revolving credit facilities; and•contain restrictive covenants that could, among other things:◦limit our ability to merge, consolidate, sell assets, incur additional indebtedness, issue preferred stock, make investments and pay dividends; and◦if breached, result in an event of default under our indebtedness.These obligations could also impact our ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, and our flexibility in the conduct of our business, and could materially adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.Further, a substantial portion of our long-term indebtedness bears interest at fluctuating interest rates, primarily based on the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) for deposits of U.S.\\xa0dollars. LIBOR tends to fluctuate based on general short-term interest rates, rates set by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks, the supply of and demand for credit in the London interbank market and general economic conditions. We have not hedged our interest rate exposure with respect to our floating rate debt. Accordingly, our interest expense for any particular period will fluctuate based on LIBOR and other variable interest rates. To the extent the interest rates applicable to our floating rate debt increase, our interest expense will increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. Similarly, it is not possible to predict whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR, or what effect these changes in views or alternatives may have on financial markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments. While the U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index, calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities, we cannot currently predict whether this index will gain widespread acceptance as a replacement for LIBOR. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment 19of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere. See also the discussion of interest rate risk in Part II, Item\\xa07A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – “Interest.”We may in the future pursue amendments to our LIBOR-based debt transactions to provide for a transaction mechanism or other reference rate in anticipation of LIBOR’s discontinuation, but we may not be able to reach agreement with our lenders on any such amendments. As of December\\xa031, 2019, we had $9.6 billion of borrowings based on LIBOR. The replacement of LIBOR with a comparable or successor rate could cause the amount of interest payable on our long-term debt to be different or higher than expected.We will need to obtain sufficient financing or other capital to operate successfully.Our business plan contemplates continued significant investments related to modernizing our fleet, improving the experience of our customers and updating our facilities. Significant capital resources will be required to execute this plan. We estimate that, based on our commitments as of December\\xa031, 2019, our planned aggregate expenditures for aircraft purchase commitments and certain engines on a consolidated basis for calendar years 2020-2024 would be approximately $8.1 billion. We may also require financing to refinance maturing obligations and to provide liquidity to fund other corporate requirements. Accordingly, we will need substantial financing or other capital resources to finance such aircraft and engines and meet such other liquidity needs. If we are unable to arrange such financing at customary advance rates and on terms and conditions acceptable to us, we may need to use cash from operations or cash on hand to purchase such aircraft and engines or may seek to negotiate deferrals for such aircraft and engines with the applicable aircraft and engine manufacturers or otherwise defer corporate obligations. Depending on numerous factors applicable at the time we seek capital, many of which are out of our control, such as the state of the domestic and global economies, the capital and credit markets’ view of our prospects and the airline industry in general, and the general availability of debt and equity capital, the financing or other capital resources that we will need may not be available to us, or may be available only on onerous terms and conditions. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining financing or other needed sources of capital to operate successfully. An inability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.The loss of key personnel upon whom we depend to operate our business or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.We believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to retain or attract highly qualified management, technical and other personnel. We may not be successful in retaining key personnel or in attracting other highly qualified personnel. Any inability to retain or attract significant numbers of qualified management and other personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Union disputes, employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions, or our inability to otherwise maintain labor costs at competitive levels may adversely affect our operations and financial performance.Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the U.S. are governed by the RLA. Under the RLA, CBAs generally contain “amendable dates” rather than expiration dates, and the RLA requires that a carrier maintain the existing terms and conditions of employment following the amendable date through a multi-stage and usually lengthy series of bargaining processes overseen by the NMB. For the dates that the CBAs with our major work groups become amendable under the RLA, see Part I, Item\\xa01. Business – “Employees and Labor Relations.”In the case of a CBA that is amendable under the RLA, if no agreement is reached during direct negotiations between the parties, either party may request that the NMB appoint a federal mediator. The RLA prescribes no timetable for the direct negotiation and mediation processes, and it is not unusual for those processes to last for many months or even several years. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the NMB in its discretion may declare that an impasse exists and proffer binding arbitration to the parties. Either party may decline to submit to arbitration, and if arbitration is rejected by either party, a 30-day “cooling off” period commences. During or after that period, a PEB may be established, which examines the parties’ positions and recommends a solution. The PEB process lasts for 30 days and is followed by another 30-day “cooling off” period. At the end of this “cooling off” period, unless an agreement is reached or action is taken by Congress, the labor organization may exercise “self-help,” such as a strike, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.None of the unions representing our employees presently may lawfully engage in concerted slowdowns or refusals to work, such as strikes, sick-outs or other similar activity, against us. Nonetheless, there is a risk that employees, either with or without union involvement, could engage in one or more concerted refusals to work that could individually or collectively harm the operation of our airline and impair our financial performance. For example, last year we initiated litigation and obtained a permanent injunction after the unions representing our mechanics and other ground workers 20engaged in an unlawful work action which adversely affected our operation. Additionally, some of our unions have brought and may continue to bring grievances to binding arbitration, including those related to wages. If successful, there is a risk these arbitral avenues could result in material additional costs that we did not anticipate. See also Part I, Item\\xa01. Business – “Employees and Labor Relations.”As of December\\xa031, 2019, approximately 85% of our employees were represented for collective bargaining purposes by labor unions. Currently, we believe our labor costs are competitive relative to the other large network carriers. However, we cannot provide assurance that labor costs going forward will remain competitive because we are in negotiations for several important new labor agreements now and other agreements are scheduled to become amendable, competitors may significantly reduce their labor costs or we may agree to higher-cost provisions unilaterally or in connection with our current or future labor negotiations.We have significant pension and other postretirement benefit funding obligations, which may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.Our pension funding obligations are significant. The amount of these obligations will depend on the performance of investments held in trust by the pension plans, interest rates for determining liabilities and actuarial experience. The minimum funding obligation applicable to our pension plans was subject to favorable temporary funding rules that expired at the end of 2017 and, as a result, our minimum pension funding obligations increased materially beginning in 2019. In addition, we have significant obligations for retiree medical and other postretirement benefits. Additionally, we participate in the International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers (IAM) National Pension Fund (the IAM Pension Fund). The funding status of the IAM Pension Fund is subject to the risk that other employers may not meet their obligations, which under certain circumstances could cause our obligations to increase. Furthermore, if we were to withdraw from the IAM Pension Fund, if the IAM Pension fund were to terminate, or if the IAM Pension Fund were to undergo a mass withdrawal, we could be subject to liability as imposed by law.   Any damage to our reputation or brand image could adversely affect our business or financial results. Maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to our business. Our reputation or brand image could be adversely impacted by, among other things, any failure to maintain high ethical, social and environmental sustainability practices for all of our operations and activities, our impact on the environment, public pressure from investors or policy groups to change our policies, such as movements to institute a “living wage,” customer perceptions of our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements or marketing programs, customer perceptions of our use of social media, or customer perceptions of statements made by us, our employees and executives, agents or other third parties. Damage to our reputation or brand image or loss of customer confidence in our services could adversely affect our business and financial results, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.We are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from any public incident involving our company, our people or our brand, including any accident or other public incident involving our personnel or aircraft, or the personnel or aircraft of our regional, codeshare or joint business operators.In a modern world where news can be captured and travel rapidly, we are at risk of adverse publicity stemming from any public incident involving our company, our people or our brand. Such an incident could involve the actual or alleged behavior of any of our more than 133,000 employees. Further, if our personnel, one of our aircraft, a type of aircraft in our fleet, or personnel of, or an aircraft that is operated under our brand by, one of our regional operators or an airline with which we have a marketing alliance, joint business or codeshare relationship, were to be involved in a public incident, accident, catastrophe or regulatory enforcement action, we could be exposed to significant reputational harm and potential legal liability. The insurance we carry may be inapplicable or inadequate to cover any such incident, accident, catastrophe or action. In the event that our insurance is inapplicable or inadequate, we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an incident or accident. In addition, any such incident, accident, catastrophe or action involving our personnel, one of our aircraft (or personnel and aircraft of our regional operators and our codeshare partners), or a type of aircraft fleet could create an adverse public perception, which could harm our reputation, result in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft or those of our regional operators or codeshare partners, and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.21Our business is subject to extensive government regulation, which may result in increases in our costs, disruptions to our operations, limits on our operating flexibility, reductions in the demand for air travel, and competitive disadvantages.Airlines are subject to extensive domestic and international regulatory requirements. In the last several years, Congress has passed laws, and the DOT, the FAA, the TSA and the DHS have issued regulations and a number of other directives, that affect the airline industry. These requirements impose substantial costs on us and restrict the ways we may conduct our business.For example, the FAA from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require significant expenditures or operational restrictions. These requirements can be issued with little or no notice, or can otherwise impact our ability to efficiently or fully utilize our aircraft, and in some instances have resulted in the temporary grounding of aircraft types altogether (including the March 2019 grounding of all Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, including the 24 aircraft in our fleet, which remains in place as of the date of this report), or otherwise caused substantial disruption and resulted in material costs to us and lost revenues. The FAA also exercises comprehensive regulatory authority over nearly all technical aspects of our operations. Our failure to comply with such requirements has in the past and may in the future result in fines and other enforcement actions by the FAA or other regulators. In the future, any new regulatory requirements, particularly requirements that limit our ability to operate or price our products, could have a material adverse effect on us and the industry.DOT consumer rules dictate procedures for customer handling during long onboard delays, further regulate airline interactions with passengers, including passengers with disabilities, through the ticketing process, at the airport, and onboard the aircraft, and require disclosures concerning airline fares and ancillary fees such as baggage fees. Other DOT rules apply to post-ticket purchase price increases and an expansion of tarmac delay regulations to international airlines. In 2020, the DOT is expected to implement a number of new regulations that will impact us, including disability rules for accessible lavatories and refunds for checked bag fees in the event of certain delays in delivery. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandates the federalization of certain airport security procedures and imposes additional security requirements on airports and airlines, most of which are funded by a per-ticket tax on passengers and a tax on airlines. Present and potential future security requirements can have the effect of imposing costs and inconvenience on travelers, potentially reducing the demand for air travel.The results of our operations, demand for air travel, and the manner in which we conduct business each may be affected by changes in law and future actions taken by governmental agencies, including:•changes in law that affect the services that can be offered by airlines in particular markets and at particular airports, or the types of fares offered or fees that can be charged to passengers;•the granting and timing of certain governmental approvals (including antitrust or foreign government approvals) needed for codesharing alliances, joint businesses and other arrangements with other airlines;•restrictions on competitive practices (for example, court orders, or agency regulations or orders, that would curtail an airline’s ability to respond to a competitor);•the adoption of new passenger security standards or regulations that impact customer service standards;•restrictions on airport operations, such as restrictions on the use of slots at airports or the auction or reallocation of slot rights currently held by us; and•the adoption of more restrictive locally-imposed noise restrictions.Each additional regulation or other form of regulatory oversight increases costs and adds greater complexity to airline operations and, in some cases, may reduce the demand for air travel. There can be no assurance that the increased costs or greater complexity associated with our compliance with new rules, anticipated rules or other forms of regulatory oversight will not have a material adverse effect on us.Any significant reduction in air traffic capacity at and in the airspace serving key airports in the U.S. or overseas could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the United States National Airspace System (the ATC system) is not successfully modernizing to meet the growing demand for U.S. air travel. Air traffic controllers rely on outdated procedures and technologies that routinely compel airlines to fly inefficient routes or take significant delays on the ground. The ATC system’s inability to manage existing travel demand has led government agencies to implement short-term capacity constraints during peak travel periods or adverse weather 22conditions in certain markets, resulting in delays and disruptions of air traffic. The outdated technologies also cause the ATC system to be less resilient in the event of a failure. For example, an automation failure and an evacuation, in 2015 and 2017 respectively, at the Washington Air Route Control Center resulted in cancellations and delays of hundreds of flights traversing the greater Washington, D.C. airspace.In the early 2000s, the FAA embarked on a path to modernize the national airspace system, including migration from the current radar-based ATC system to a GPS-based system. This modernization of the ATC system, generally referred to as “NextGen,” has been plagued by delays and cost overruns, and it remains uncertain when the full array of benefits expected from this modernization will be available to the public and the airlines. Failure to update the ATC system in a timely manner and the substantial costs that may be imposed on airlines in order to fund a modernized ATC system may have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, our business has been adversely impacted when government agencies have ceased to operate as expected including due to partial shut-downs, sequestrations or similar events. These events have resulted in, among other things, reduced demand for air travel, an actual or perceived reduction in ATC and security screening resources and related travel delays, as well as disruption in the ability of the FAA to grant required regulatory approvals, such as those that are involved when a new aircraft is first placed into service. Our operating authority in international markets is subject to aviation agreements between the U.S. and the respective countries or governmental authorities, such as the EU, and in some cases, fares and schedules require the approval of the DOT and/or the relevant foreign governments. Moreover, alliances with international carriers may be subject to the jurisdiction and regulations of various foreign agencies. The U.S. government has negotiated “open skies” agreements with many countries, which agreements allow unrestricted route authority access between the U.S. and the foreign markets. While the U.S. has worked to increase the number of countries with which open skies agreements are in effect, a number of markets important to us, including China, do not have open skies agreements. For example, the open skies air services agreement between the U.S. and the EU, which took effect in March 2008, provides airlines from the U.S. and EU member states open access to each other’s markets, with freedom of pricing and unlimited rights to fly from the U.S. to any airport in the EU. As a result of the agreement and a subsequent open skies agreement involving the U.S. and the United Kingdom, which was agreed in anticipation of Brexit, we face increased competition in these markets, including LHR. Bilateral and multilateral agreements among the U.S. and various foreign governments of countries we serve but which are not covered by an open skies treaty are subject to periodic renegotiation. We currently operate a number of international routes under government arrangements that limit the number of airlines permitted to operate on the route, the capacity of the airlines providing services on the route, or the number of airlines allowed access to particular airports. If an open skies policy were to be adopted for any of these markets, it could have a material adverse impact on us and could result in the impairment of material amounts of our related tangible and intangible assets. In addition, competition from foreign airlines, revenue-sharing joint ventures, JBAs, and other alliance arrangements by and among other airlines could impair the value of our business and assets on the open skies routes. Brexit occurred on January 31, 2020 under the terms of the agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community (the Withdrawal Agreement). There will now be a transition period during which the United Kingdom and the EU will seek to negotiate an agreement governing their future relationship, including in relation to air services. Under the Withdrawal Agreement, this transition period is scheduled to end on December 31, 2020, with a potential extension of up to two years, although the United Kingdom government has passed legislation preventing any such extension of the transition period. We face risks associated with Brexit, notably given the extent of our passenger and cargo traffic and that of our joint business partners that flows through LHR in the United Kingdom. During the transition period, our current air services may continue as we currently conduct them. However, Brexit will mandate further modification in the current regulatory regime, including in relation to commercial air service.  The precise scope of traffic rights between the EU and the United Kingdom remains uncertain and therefore the continuation of our current services is not assured and could be subject to disruption. During the transition period, the United Kingdom and the EU will seek to implement a new air services agreement. We cannot predict the terms of any such successor air services agreement or whether changes in the relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU, including whether or not an agreement governing their future relationship is reached before the end of the transition period, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. More generally, changes in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements, diminish the value of route authorities, slots or other assets located abroad, or otherwise adversely affect our international operations.23We operate a global business with international operations that are subject to economic and political instability and have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control.We operate a global business with significant operations outside of the U.S. Our current international activities and prospects have been and in the future could be adversely affected by government policies, reversals or delays in the opening of foreign markets, increased competition in international markets, the performance of our alliance, joint business and codeshare partners in a given market, exchange controls or other restrictions on repatriation of funds, currency and political risks (including changes in exchange rates and currency devaluations), environmental regulation, increases in taxes and fees and changes in international government regulation of our operations, including the inability to obtain or retain needed route authorities and/or slots. Fluctuations in foreign currencies, including devaluations, exchange controls and other restrictions on the repatriation of funds, have significantly affected and may continue to significantly affect our operating performance, liquidity and the value of any cash held outside the U.S. in local currency. Such fluctuations in foreign currencies, including devaluations, cannot be predicted by us and can significantly affect the value of our assets located outside the United States. These conditions, as well as any further delays, devaluations or imposition of more stringent repatriation restrictions, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.More generally, our industry may be affected by any deterioration in global trade relations, including shifts in the trade policies of individual nations. For example, much of the demand for international air travel is the result of business travel in support of global trade. Should protectionist governmental policies, such as increased tariff or other trade barriers, travel limitations and other regulatory actions, have the effect of reducing global commercial activity, the result could be a material decrease in the demand for international air travel. Additionally, certain of the products and services that we purchase, including certain of our aircraft and related parts, are sourced from suppliers located in foreign countries, and the imposition of new tariffs, or any increase in existing tariffs, by the U.S. government in respect of the importation of such products could materially increase the amounts we pay for them. In particular, on October 2, 2019, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), as part of an ongoing dispute with the EU before the World Trade Organization (WTO) concerning, among other things, aircraft subsidies, was authorized by an arbitration tribunal of the WTO to impose up to $7.5 billion per year in import tariffs on certain goods originating from the EU. In October 2019, the USTR imposed tariffs on certain imports from the EU, including certain Airbus aircraft that we previously contracted to purchase, which were initially subject to an ad valorem duty of 10%. On February 14, 2020, the USTR increased such duty to 15% effective March 18, 2020. While the scope and rate of these tariffs are subject to change, if and to the extent these tariffs are imposed on us without any available means for us to mitigate or pass on the burden of these tariffs to Airbus, the effective cost of new Airbus aircraft required to implement our fleet plan would increase.Brexit occurred on January 31, 2020 under the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement. There will now be a transition period during which the United Kingdom and the EU will seek to negotiate an agreement governing their future relationship, including in relation to air services. Under the Withdrawal Agreement, this transition period is scheduled to end on December 31, 2020, with a potential extension of up to two years, although the United Kingdom government has passed legislation preventing any such extension of the transition period. We face risks associated with Brexit, notably given the extent of our passenger and cargo traffic and that of our joint business partners that flows through LHR in the United Kingdom. During the transition period, our current air services may continue as we currently conduct them. The precise scope of traffic rights between the EU and the United Kingdom remains uncertain and therefore the continuation is not assured and could be subject to disruption. During the transition period, the United Kingdom and the EU will seek to implement a new air services agreement. We cannot predict the terms of any such successor air services agreement or whether changes in the relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU, including whether or not an agreement governing their future relationship is reached before the end of the transition period, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Moreover, Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide economic or market conditions and could contribute to further instability in global financial markets. In addition, Brexit has created uncertainty as to the future trade relationship between the EU and the United Kingdom, including air traffic services. LHR is presently a very important element of our international network, however it may become less desirable as a destination or as a hub location after Brexit when compared to other airports in Europe. Brexit could also lead to legal and regulatory uncertainty such as the identity of the relevant regulators, new regulatory action and/or potentially divergent treaties, laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which EU treaties, laws and regulations to replace or replicate, including those governing aviation, labor, environmental, data protection/privacy, competition and other matters applicable to the provision of air transportation services by us or our alliance, joint business or codeshare partners. For example in October 2018, in anticipation of Brexit and the expiry of the EC commitments in July 2020, the CMA opened an investigation into the transatlantic JBA. We continue to fully cooperate with the CMA. The impact on our business of any treaties, laws and regulations that replace the existing EU counterparts, or other governmental or regulatory actions taken by the United Kingdom or the EU in 24connection with or subsequent to Brexit, cannot be predicted, including whether or not regulators will continue to approve or impose material conditions on our business activities. Any of these effects, and others we cannot anticipate, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.We may be adversely affected by conflicts overseas or terrorist attacks; the travel industry continues to face ongoing security concerns.Acts of terrorism or fear of such attacks, including elevated national threat warnings, wars or other military conflicts, may depress air travel, particularly on international routes, and cause declines in revenues and increases in costs. The attacks of September\\xa011, 2001 and continuing terrorist threats, attacks and attempted attacks materially impacted and continue to impact air travel. Increased security procedures introduced at airports since the attacks of September\\xa011, 2001 and any other such measures that may be introduced in the future generate higher operating costs for airlines. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandated improved flight deck security, deployment of federal air marshals on board flights, improved airport perimeter access security, airline crew security training, enhanced security screening of passengers, baggage, cargo, mail, employees and vendors, enhanced training and qualifications of security screening personnel, additional provision of passenger data to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency and enhanced background checks. A concurrent increase in airport security charges and procedures, such as restrictions on carry-on baggage, has also had and may continue to have a disproportionate impact on short-haul travel, which constitutes a significant portion of our flying and revenue. Implementation of and compliance with increasingly-complex security and customs requirements will continue to result in increased costs for us and our passengers, and have caused and likely will continue to cause periodic service disruptions and delays. We have at times found it necessary or desirable to make significant expenditures to comply with security-related requirements while seeking to reduce their impact on our customers, such as expenditures for automated security screening lines at airports. As a result of competitive pressure, and the need to improve security screening throughput to support the pace of our operations, it is unlikely that we will be able to capture all security-related costs through increased fares. In addition, we cannot forecast what new security requirements may be imposed in the future, or their impact on our business.We are subject to risks associated with climate change, including increased regulation of our CO2 emissions and the potential increased impacts of severe weather events on our operations and infrastructure. There is increasing global regulatory focus on climate change and emissions of GHGs, including CO2. In particular, ICAO is in the process of adopting rules, including CORSIA, that will require American to limit the CO2 emissions of a significant majority of our international flights to a baseline level equal to our 2019-2020 average emissions from such flights.At this time, the costs of our obligations under CORSIA are uncertain and cannot be fully predicted. For example, we will not directly control our CORSIA compliance costs during the CORSIA Pilot and First Phases because such phases include a sharing mechanism for the growth in emissions for the global aviation sector. In addition, there is uncertainty with respect to the future supply, demand and price of sustainable or lower carbon aircraft fuel, carbon offset credits and technologies that could allow airlines to reduce their emissions of CO2. Due to the competitive nature of the airline industry and unpredictability of the market for air travel, we can offer no assurance that we may be able to increase our fares, impose surcharges or otherwise increase revenues or decrease other operating costs sufficiently to offset our costs of meeting obligations under CORSIA.In the event that CORSIA does not come into force as expected, American and other airlines could become subject to an unpredictable and inconsistent array of national or regional emissions restrictions, creating a patchwork of complex regulatory requirements that will often affect global competitors differently and frequently offer no meaningful aviation environmental improvements. Concerns over climate change are likely to result in the continued adoption of municipal, state, regional, and federal requirements or in changing business environments that may result in increased costs to the airline industry and us. In addition, several countries and U.S. states have adopted or are considering adopting programs to regulate GHG emissions. Finally, certain airports have adopted, and others could in the future adopt, GHG emission or climate-neutral goals that could impact our operations or require us to make changes or investments in our infrastructure.All such climate change-related regulatory activity and developments may adversely affect our business and financial results by requiring us to reduce our emissions, make capital investments to modernize certain aspects of our operations, purchase carbon offset credits, or otherwise pay for our emissions. Such activity may also impact us indirectly by increasing our operating costs, including fuel costs.25Finally, the potential physical effects of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, fires, sea-level rise and other climate-related events, could affect our operations, infrastructure and financial results. Operational impacts, such as the canceling of flights, could result in loss of revenue. We could incur significant costs to improve the climate resiliency of our infrastructure and otherwise prepare for, respond to, and mitigate such physical effects of climate change. We are not able to accurately predict the materiality of any potential losses or costs associated with the physical effects of climate change.We are subject to many forms of environmental and noise regulation and may incur substantial costs as a result.We are subject to a number of increasingly stringent federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and ordinances relating to the protection of the environment and noise reduction, including those relating to emissions to the air, discharges to surface and subsurface waters, safe drinking water, and the management of hazardous substances, oils and waste materials. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures, and violations can lead to significant fines and penalties.We are also subject to other environmental laws and regulations, including those that require us to investigate and remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain remediation standards. Under federal law, generators of waste materials, and current and former owners or operators of facilities, can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at locations that have been identified as requiring response actions. Liability under these laws may be strict, joint and several, meaning that we could be liable for the costs of cleaning up environmental contamination regardless of fault or the amount of waste directly attributable to us. We have liability for investigation and remediation costs at various sites, although such costs currently are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business.We have various leases and agreements with respect to real property, tanks and pipelines with airports and other operators. Under these leases and agreements, we have agreed to indemnify the lessor or operator against environmental liabilities associated with the real property or operations described under the agreement, even in certain cases where we are not the party responsible for the initial event that caused the environmental damage. We also participate in leases with other airlines in fuel consortiums and fuel committees at airports, and such indemnities are generally joint and several among the participating airlines.Governmental authorities in several U.S. and foreign cities are also considering, or have already implemented, aircraft noise reduction programs, including the imposition of nighttime curfews and limitations on daytime take offs and landings. We have been able to accommodate local noise restrictions imposed to date, but our operations could be adversely affected if locally-imposed regulations become more restrictive or widespread.We depend on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft, aircraft engines and parts.We depend on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft, aircraft engines and many aircraft and engine parts. For example, under our current fleet plan, by the end of 2020 all of our mainline aircraft will have been manufactured by either Airbus or Boeing and all of our regional aircraft will have been manufactured by either Bombardier or Embraer. Further, our supplier base continues to consolidate as evidenced by the recent acquisition of Rockwell Collins by United Technologies, the recent transactions involving Airbus and Bombardier and the pending transactions involving Boeing and Embraer, and Bombardier and Mitsubishi. Due to the limited number of these suppliers, we are vulnerable to any problems associated with the performance of their obligation to supply key aircraft, parts and engines, including design defects, mechanical problems, contractual performance by suppliers, adverse perception by the public that would result in customer avoidance of any of our aircraft or any action by the FAA or any other regulatory authority resulting in an inability to operate our aircraft, even temporarily. In particular, in March 2019, the FAA ordered the grounding of all Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, which remains in place as of the date of this report.Delays in scheduled aircraft deliveries or other loss of anticipated fleet capacity, and failure of new aircraft to perform as expected, may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.The success of our business depends on, among other things, effectively managing the number and types of aircraft we operate. If, for any reason, we are unable to accept or secure deliveries of new aircraft on contractually scheduled delivery dates, this could have negative impacts on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our failure to integrate newly purchased aircraft into our fleet as planned might require us to seek extensions of the terms for some leased aircraft or otherwise delay the exit of certain aircraft from our fleet. Such unanticipated extensions or delays may require us to operate existing aircraft beyond the point at which it is economically optimal to retire them, resulting in increased maintenance costs, or reductions to our schedule, thereby reducing revenues. If new aircraft orders are not filled on a timely basis, we could face higher financing and operating costs than planned. In addition, if the aircraft we 26receive do not meet expected performance or quality standards, including with respect to fuel efficiency, safety and reliability, we could face higher financing and operating costs than planned and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. For instance, in March 2019, the FAA grounded all Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, including the 24 aircraft in our fleet. For the duration of the Boeing 737 MAX grounding, we have been unable to take delivery of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft we have on order from Boeing and have in some instances been required to extend the service lives of older, less efficient aircraft and delay service that we planned to offer. Further, deliveries of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft have remained suspended following the grounding, and Boeing is not currently manufacturing new 737 MAX aircraft. Depending on the ultimate duration of the grounding, various Boeing 737 MAX aircraft financings we previously obtained may be terminated and, as a result, we may be required to obtain alternate financing for these aircraft, which may not be available on terms and conditions as favorable as the previously obtained financings. Further, once the grounding has been lifted, we are likely to be subject to training requirements. Boeing has recommended that pilots receive special flight simulator training before operating the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, and although the FAA is ultimately responsible for establishing training requirements for operating the Boeing 737 MAX, such additional training would further delay the aircraft’s return to service and impose restrictions on our ability to optimize our fleet. This and other operational requirements and uncertainties regarding the timing of the delivery of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft we have on order and how rapidly we will be able to take delivery of and integrate such Boeing 737 MAX aircraft into our fleet could potentially result in further significant constraints on our operating efficiency, capacity and growth plans.We rely heavily on technology and automated systems to operate our business, and any failure of these technologies or systems could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.We are highly dependent on existing and emerging technology and automated systems to operate our business. These technologies and systems include our computerized airline reservation system, flight operations systems, financial planning, management and accounting systems, telecommunications systems, website, maintenance systems and check-in kiosks. In order for our operations to work efficiently, our website and reservation system must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic, maintain secure information and deliver flight information, as well as issue electronic tickets and process critical financial information in a timely manner. Substantially all of our tickets are issued to passengers as electronic tickets. We depend on our reservation system, which is hosted and maintained under a long-term contract by a third-party service provider, to be able to issue, track and accept these electronic tickets. If our technologies or automated systems are not functioning or if our third-party service providers were to fail to adequately provide technical support, system maintenance or timely software upgrades for any one of our key existing systems, we could experience service disruptions or delays, which could harm our business and result in the loss of important data, increase our expenses and decrease our revenues. In the event that one or more of our primary technology or systems vendors goes into bankruptcy, ceases operations or fails to perform as promised, replacement services may not be readily available on a timely basis, at competitive rates or at all, and any transition time to a new system may be significant.Our technologies and automated systems cannot be completely protected against events that are beyond our control, including natural disasters, power failures, terrorist attacks, cyber-attacks, data theft, equipment and software failures, computer viruses or telecommunications failures. Substantial or sustained system failures could cause service delays or failures and result in our customers purchasing tickets from other airlines. We cannot assure that our security measures, change control procedures or disaster recovery plans are adequate to prevent disruptions or delays. Disruption in or changes to these technologies or systems could result in a disruption to our business and the loss of important data. Any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We face challenges in integrating our computer, communications and other technology systems. While we have to date successfully integrated many of our computer, communication and other technology systems in connection with the merger of US Airways and American, including our customer reservations system and our pilot, flight attendant and fleet scheduling system, we still have to complete several additional important system integration or replacement projects. In a number of prior airline mergers, the integration of these systems or deployment of replacement systems has taken longer, been more disruptive and cost more than originally forecasted. The implementation process to integrate or replace these various systems will involve a number of risks that could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. New systems will replace multiple legacy systems and the related implementation will be a complex and time-consuming project involving substantial expenditures for implementation consultants, system hardware, software and implementation activities, as well as the transformation of business and financial processes.27We cannot assure that our security measures, change control procedures or disaster recovery plans will be adequate to prevent disruptions or delays in connection with systems integration or replacement. Disruptions in or changes to these systems could result in a disruption to our business and the loss of important data. Any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Evolving data security and privacy requirements could increase our costs, and any significant data security incident could disrupt our operations, harm our reputation, expose us to legal risks and otherwise materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our business requires the secure processing and storage of sensitive information relating to our customers, employees, business partners and others. However, like any global enterprise operating in today’s digital business environment, we are subject to threats to the security of our networks and data, including threats potentially involving criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored actors, corporate espionage, employee malfeasance, and human or technological error. These threats continue to increase as the frequency, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions increase around the world. We have been the target of cybersecurity attacks in the past and expect that we will continue to be in the future. Furthermore, in response to these threats there has been heightened legislative and regulatory focus on data privacy and cybersecurity in the U.S., the EU and elsewhere, particularly with respect to critical infrastructure providers, including those in the transportation sector. As a result, we must comply with a proliferating and fast-evolving set of legal requirements in this area, including substantive cybersecurity standards as well as requirements for notifying regulators and affected individuals in the event of a data security incident. This regulatory environment is increasingly challenging and may present material obligations and risks to our business, including significantly expanded compliance burdens, costs and enforcement risks. For example, in May 2018, the EU’s new General Data Protection Regulation, commonly referred to as GDPR, came into effect, which imposes a host of new data privacy and security requirements, imposing significant costs on us and carrying substantial penalties for non-compliance. In addition, many of our commercial partners, including credit card companies, have imposed data security standards that we must meet. In particular, we are required by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council, founded by the credit card companies, to comply with their highest level of data security standards. While we continue our efforts to meet these standards, new and revised standards may be imposed that may be difficult for us to meet and could increase our costs. A significant cybersecurity incident could result in a range of potentially material negative consequences for us, including unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss or destruction of company systems or data; theft of sensitive, regulated or confidential data, such as personal identifying information or our intellectual property; the loss of functionality of critical systems through ransomware, denial of service or other attacks; a deterioration in our relationships with business partners and other third parties; and business delays, service or system disruptions, damage to equipment and injury to persons or property. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time. The constantly changing nature of the threats means that we may not be able to prevent all data security breaches or misuse of data. Similarly, we depend on the ability of our key commercial partners, including our regional carriers, distribution partners and technology vendors, to conduct their businesses in a manner that complies with applicable security standards and assures their ability to perform on a timely basis. A security failure, including a failure to meet relevant payment security standards, breach or other significant cybersecurity incident affecting one of our partners could result in potentially material negative consequences for us.In addition, the costs and operational consequences of defending against, preparing for, responding to and remediating an incident of cybersecurity breach may be substantial. As cybersecurity threats become more frequent, intense and sophisticated, costs of proactive defense measures are increasing. Further, we could be exposed to litigation, regulatory enforcement or other legal action as a result of an incident, carrying the potential for damages, fines, sanctions or other penalties, as well as injunctive relief and enforcement actions requiring costly compliance measures. A significant number of recent privacy and data security incidents, including those involving other large airlines, have resulted in very substantial adverse financial consequences to those companies. A cybersecurity incident could also impact our brand, harm our reputation and adversely impact our relationship with our customers, employees and stockholders. Accordingly, failure to appropriately address these issues could result in material financial and other liabilities and cause significant reputational harm to our company.28If we encounter problems with any of our third-party regional operators or third-party service providers, our operations could be adversely affected by a resulting decline in revenue or negative public perception about our services.A significant portion of our regional operations are conducted by third-party operators on our behalf, substantially all of which are provided for under capacity purchase agreements. Due to our reliance on third parties to provide these essential services, we are subject to the risk of disruptions to their operations, which has in the past and may in the future result from many of the same risk factors disclosed in this report, such as the impact of adverse economic conditions, the inability of third parties to hire or retain skilled personnel, including pilots and mechanics, and other risk factors, such as an out-of-court or bankruptcy restructuring of any of our regional operators. Several of these third-party regional operators provide significant regional capacity that we would be unable to replace in a short period of time should that operator fail to perform its obligations to us. Disruptions to capital markets, shortages of skilled personnel and adverse economic conditions in general have subjected certain of these third-party regional operators to significant financial pressures, which have in the past and may in the future lead to bankruptcies among these operators. We may also experience disruption to our regional operations if we terminate the capacity purchase agreement with one or more of our current operators and transition the services to another provider. Any significant disruption to our regional operations would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.In addition, our reliance upon others to provide essential services on behalf of our operations may result in our relative inability to control the efficiency and timeliness of contract services. We have entered into agreements with contractors to provide various facilities and services required for our operations, including distribution and sale of airline seat inventory, reservations, provision of information technology and services, regional operations, aircraft maintenance, ground services and facilities and baggage handling. Similar agreements may be entered into in any new markets we decide to serve. These agreements are generally subject to termination after notice by the third-party service provider. We are also at risk should\\xa0one of these service providers cease operations,\\xa0and there is no guarantee that we could replace these providers on a timely basis\\xa0with comparably priced providers, or at all. Any material problems with the efficiency and timeliness of contract services, resulting from financial hardships or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We rely on third-party distribution channels and must manage effectively the costs, rights and functionality of these channels.We rely on third-party distribution channels, including those provided by or through global distribution systems (GDSs) (e.g., Amadeus, Sabre and Travelport), conventional travel agents, travel management companies and online travel agents (OTAs) (e.g., Expedia, including its booking sites Orbitz and Travelocity, and Booking Holdings, including its booking sites Kayak and Priceline), to distribute a significant portion of our airline tickets, and we expect in the future to continue to rely on these channels. We are also dependent upon the ability and willingness of these distribution channels to expand their ability to distribute and collect revenues for ancillary products (e.g., fees for selective seating). These distribution channels are more expensive and at present have less functionality in respect of ancillary product offerings than those we operate ourselves, such as our website at www.aa.com. Certain of these distribution channels also effectively restrict the manner in which we distribute our products generally. To remain competitive, we will need to manage successfully our distribution costs and rights, increase our distribution flexibility and improve the functionality of our distribution channels, while maintaining an industry-competitive cost structure. Further, as distribution technology changes we will need to continue to update our technology by acquiring new technology from third parties, building the functionality ourselves, or a combination, which in any event will likely entail significant technological and commercial risk and involve potentially material investments. These imperatives may affect our relationships with conventional travel agents, travel management companies, GDSs and OTAs, including if consolidation of conventional travel agents, travel management companies, GDSs or OTAs continues, or should any of these parties seek to acquire other technology providers thereby potentially limiting our technology alternatives, such as the proposed acquisition of Farelogix by Sabre. Any inability to manage our third-party distribution costs, rights and functionality at a competitive level or any material diminishment or disruption in the distribution of our tickets could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.29If we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate facilities and infrastructure throughout our system and, at some airports, adequate slots, we may be unable to operate our existing flight schedule and to expand or change our route network in the future, which may have a material adverse impact on our operations.In order to operate our existing and proposed flight schedule and, where desirable, add service along new or existing routes, we must be able to maintain and/or obtain adequate gates, check-in counters, operations areas, operations control facilities and administrative support space. As airports around the world become more congested, it may not be possible for us to ensure that our plans for new service can be implemented in a commercially viable manner, given operating constraints at airports throughout our network, including those imposed by inadequate facilities at desirable airports.In light of constraints on existing facilities, there is presently a significant amount of capital spending underway at major airports in the United States, including large projects underway at a number of airports where we have significant operations, such as DCA, LAX, LGA and ORD. This spending is expected to result in increased costs to airlines and the traveling public that use those facilities as the airports seek to recover their investments through increased rental, landing and other facility costs. In some circumstances, such costs could be imposed by the relevant airport authority without our approval. Accordingly, our operating costs are expected to increase significantly at many airports at which we operate, including a number of our hubs and gateways, as a result of capital spending projects currently underway and additional projects that we expect to commence over the next several years. In addition, operations at three major domestic airports, certain smaller domestic airports and many foreign airports  we serve are regulated by governmental entities through allocations of slots or similar regulatory mechanisms that limit the rights of carriers to conduct operations at those airports. Each slot represents the authorization to land at or take off from the particular airport during a specified time period and may have other operational restrictions as well. In the U.S., the DOT and the FAA currently regulate the allocation of slots or slot exemptions at DCA and two New York City airports: JFK and LGA. Our operations at these airports generally require the allocation of slots or similar regulatory authority. In addition to slot restrictions, operations at DCA and LGA are also limited based on a so-called “perimeter rule” which generally limits the stage length of the flights that can be operated from those airports to 1,250 and 1,500 miles, respectively. Similarly, our operations at LHR, international airports in Beijing, Frankfurt, Paris, Tokyo and other airports outside the U.S. are regulated by local slot authorities pursuant to the IATA Worldwide Scheduling Guidelines and/or applicable local law. Termination of slot controls at some or all of the foregoing airports could affect our operational performance and competitive position. We currently have sufficient slots or analogous authorizations to operate our existing flights and we have generally, but not always, been able to obtain the rights to expand our operations and to change our schedules. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient slots or analogous authorizations in the future or as to the cost of acquiring such rights because, among other reasons, such allocations are often sought after by other airlines and are subject to changes in governmental policies. We cannot provide any assurance that regulatory changes regarding the allocation of slots, the continued enforcement of a perimeter rule or similar regulatory authority will not have a material adverse impact on our operations.Our ability to provide service can also be impaired at airports, such as LAX and ORD where the airport gate and other facilities are currently inadequate to accommodate all of the service that we would like to provide, or airports such as Dallas Love Field Airport where we have no access to gates at all.Any limitation on our ability to acquire or maintain adequate gates, ticketing facilities, operations areas, operations control facilities, slots (where applicable), or office space could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our key facilities could have a material adverse impact on our operations.We operate principally through our hubs and gateways in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, London Heathrow, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. Substantially all of our flights either originate at or fly into one of these locations. A significant interruption or disruption in service at one of our hubs, gateways or other airports where we have a significant presence, resulting from ATC delays, weather conditions, natural disasters, growth constraints, performance by third-party service providers (such as electric utility or telecommunications providers), failure of computer systems, disruptions at airport facilities or other key facilities used by us to manage our operations (such as occurred in the United Kingdom at LGW on December 20, 2018 and LHR on January 8, 2019 due to unauthorized drone activity), labor relations, power supplies, fuel supplies, terrorist activities, or otherwise could result in the cancellation or delay of a significant portion of our flights and, as a result, could have a severe impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have limited control, particularly in the short term, over the operation, quality or maintenance of many of the services on which our operations depend and over whether vendors of such services will improve or continue to provide services that are essential to our business.30Changes to our business model that are designed to increase revenues may not be successful and may cause operational difficulties or decreased demand.We have recently instituted, and intend to institute in the future, changes to our business model designed to increase revenues and offset costs. These measures include further segmentation of the classes of services we offer, such as Premium Economy service and Basic Economy service, enhancements to our AAdvantage loyalty program, charging separately for services that had previously been included within the price of a ticket, increasing other pre-existing fees, reconfiguration of our aircraft cabins, and efforts to optimize our network including by focusing growth on a limited number of large hubs. We may introduce additional initiatives in the future; however, as time goes on, we expect that it will be more difficult to identify and implement additional initiatives. We cannot assure that these measures or any future initiatives will be successful in increasing our revenues. Additionally, the implementation of these initiatives may create logistical challenges that could harm the operational performance of our airline or result in decreased demand. Also, our implementation of any new or increased fees might reduce the demand for air travel on our airline or across the industry in general, particularly if weakened economic conditions make our customers more sensitive to increased travel costs or provide a significant competitive advantage to other carriers that determine not to institute similar charges.Our intellectual property rights, particularly our branding rights, are valuable, and any inability to protect them may adversely affect our business and financial results. We consider our intellectual property rights, particularly our branding rights such as our trademarks applicable to our airline and AAdvantage loyalty program, to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. We protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark, copyright and other forms of legal protection, contractual agreements and policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property or any change in law that lessens or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and adversely affect our business and financial results. Any litigation or disputes regarding intellectual property may be costly and time-consuming and may divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, either of which may adversely affect our business and financial results.We may be a party to litigation in the normal course of business or otherwise, which could affect our financial position and liquidity.From time to time, we are a party to or otherwise involved in legal proceedings, claims and government inspections or investigations and other legal matters, both inside and outside the United States, arising in the ordinary course of our business or otherwise. We are currently involved in various legal proceedings and claims that have not yet been fully resolved, and additional claims may arise in the future. Legal proceedings can be complex and take many months, or even years, to reach resolution, with the final outcome depending on a number of variables, some of which are not within our control. Litigation is subject to significant uncertainty and may be expensive, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations. Although we will vigorously defend ourselves in such legal proceedings, their ultimate resolution and potential financial and other impacts on us are uncertain. For these and other reasons, we may choose to settle legal proceedings and claims, regardless of their actual merit. If a legal proceeding is resolved against us, it could result in significant compensatory damages, and in certain circumstances punitive or trebled damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief imposed on us. If our existing insurance does not cover the amount or types of damages awarded, or if other resolution or actions taken as a result of the legal proceeding were to restrain our ability to operate or market our services, our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, legal proceedings, and any adverse resolution thereof, can result in adverse publicity and damage to our reputation, which could adversely impact our business. Additional information regarding certain legal matters in which we are involved can be found in Part I, Item\\xa03. Legal Proceedings.A higher than normal number of pilot retirements, more stringent duty time regulations, increased flight hour requirement for commercial airline pilots, reductions in the number of military pilots entering the commercial workforce, increased training requirements and other factors have caused a shortage of pilots that could materially adversely affect our business.We currently have a higher than normal number of pilots eligible for retirement. Large numbers of pilots in the industry are approaching the FAA’s mandatory retirement age of 65. Our pilots and other employees are subject to rigorous certification standards, and our pilots and other crew members must adhere to flight time and rest requirements. Commencing in 2013, the minimum flight hour requirement to achieve a commercial pilot’s license in the United States (an Air Transport Pilot’s certificate) increased from 250 to 1,500 hours, thereby significantly increasing the time and cost commitment required to become licensed to fly commercial aircraft. Additionally, the number of military pilots being trained by the U.S. armed forces and available as commercial pilots upon their retirement from military service has been decreasing. These and other factors have contributed to a shortage of qualified, entry-level pilots and increased compensation costs, 31particularly for our regional subsidiaries and our other regional partners who are being required by market conditions to pay significantly increased wages and large signing bonuses to their pilots in an attempt to achieve desired staffing levels. The foregoing factors have also led to increased competition from large, mainline carriers attempting to meet their hiring needs. We believe that this industry-wide pilot shortage is becoming an increasing problem for airlines in the United States. Our regional partners have recently been unable to hire adequate numbers of pilots to meet their needs, resulting in a reduction in the number of flights offered, disruptions, increased costs of operations, financial difficulties and other adverse effects, and these circumstances may become more severe in the future and thereby cause a material adverse effect on our business.Increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may adversely impact our operations and financial results.The terrorist attacks of September\\xa011, 2001 led to a significant increase in insurance premiums and a decrease in the insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers. Accordingly, our insurance costs increased significantly, and our ability to continue to obtain insurance even at current prices remains uncertain. If we are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the claims paying ability of some insurers. Future downgrades in the ratings of enough insurers could adversely impact both the availability of appropriate insurance coverage and its cost. Because of competitive pressures in our industry, our ability to pass along additional insurance costs to passengers is limited. As a result, further increases in insurance costs or reductions in available insurance coverage could have an adverse impact on our financial results.The airline industry is heavily taxed.The airline industry is subject to extensive government fees and taxation that negatively impact our revenue and profitability. The U.S. airline industry is one of the most heavily taxed of all industries. These fees and taxes have grown significantly in the past decade for domestic flights, and various U.S. fees and taxes also are assessed on international flights. For example, as permitted by federal legislation, most major U.S. airports impose a per-passenger facility charge on us. In addition, the governments of foreign countries in which we operate impose on U.S. airlines, including us, various fees and taxes, and these assessments have been increasing in number and amount in recent years. Moreover, we are obligated to collect a federal excise tax, commonly referred to as the “ticket tax,” on domestic and international air transportation. We collect the excise tax, along with certain other U.S. and foreign taxes and user fees on air transportation (such as passenger security fees), and pass along the collected amounts to the appropriate governmental agencies. Although these taxes and fees are not our operating expenses, they represent an additional cost to our customers. There are continuing efforts in Congress and in other countries to raise different portions of the various taxes, fees, and charges imposed on airlines and their passengers, including the passenger facility charge, and we may not be able to recover all of these charges from our customers. Increases in such taxes, fees and charges could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.Under DOT regulations, all governmental taxes and fees must be included in the prices we quote or advertise to our customers. Due to the competitive revenue environment, many increases in these fees and taxes have been absorbed by the airline industry rather than being passed on to the customer. Further increases in fees and taxes may reduce demand for air travel, and thus our revenues.Our ability to utilize our NOL Carryforwards may be limited.Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), a corporation is generally allowed a deduction for net operating losses (NOLs) carried over from prior taxable years (NOL Carryforwards). As of December\\xa031, 2019, we had available NOL Carryforwards of approximately $9.1 billion for regular federal income tax purposes that will expire, if unused, beginning in 2023, and approximately $3.0 billion for state income tax purposes that will expire, if unused, between 2020 and 2039. Our NOL Carryforwards are subject to adjustment on audit by the Internal Revenue Service and the respective state taxing authorities.A corporation’s ability to deduct its federal NOL Carryforwards and to utilize certain other available tax attributes can be substantially constrained under the general annual limitation rules of Section\\xa0382 of the Code (Section 382) if it undergoes an “ownership change” as defined in Section\\xa0382 (generally where cumulative stock ownership changes among material stockholders exceed 50 percent during a rolling three-year period). In 2013, we experienced an ownership change in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy and US Airways Group experienced an ownership change in connection with the Merger. The general limitation rules for a debtor in a bankruptcy case are liberalized where the ownership change occurs upon emergence from bankruptcy. We elected to be covered by certain special rules for federal income tax purposes that permitted approximately $9.0 billion (with $7.3 billion of unlimited NOL still remaining at December\\xa031, 2019) of our 32federal NOL Carryforwards to be utilized without regard to the annual limitation generally imposed by Section\\xa0382. If the special rules are determined not to apply, our ability to utilize such federal NOL Carryforwards may be subject to limitation. Substantially all of our remaining federal NOL Carryforwards attributable to US Airways Group and its subsidiaries are subject to limitation under Section\\xa0382 as a result of the Merger; however, our ability to utilize such NOL Carryforwards is not anticipated to be effectively constrained as a result of such limitation. Similar limitations may apply for state income tax purposes.Notwithstanding the foregoing, an ownership change subsequent to our emergence from bankruptcy may severely limit or effectively eliminate our ability to utilize our NOL Carryforwards and other tax attributes. To reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on our ability to utilize our NOL Carryforwards, our Certificate of Incorporation contains transfer restrictions applicable to certain substantial stockholders. These restrictions may adversely affect the ability of certain holders of AAG common stock to dispose of or acquire shares of AAG common stock. Although the purpose of these transfer restrictions is to prevent an ownership change from occurring, no assurance can be given that an ownership change will not occur even with these restrictions in place. See also “Certain provisions of AAG’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our Board of Directors and may discourage takeover attempts that some of our stockholders might consider beneficial.” Our ability to use our NOL Carryforwards also will depend on the amount of taxable income generated in future periods. The NOL Carryforwards may expire before we can generate sufficient taxable income to use them.The commercial relationships that we have with other airlines, including any related equity investment, may not produce the returns or results we expect.An important part of our strategy to expand our network has been to expand our commercial relationships with other airlines, such as by entering into global alliance, joint business and codeshare relationships, and, in one recent instance involving China Southern Airlines Company Limited (China Southern Airlines), by making a significant equity investment in another airline in connection with initiating such a commercial relationship. We may explore similar non-controlling investments in, and joint ventures and strategic alliances with, other carriers as part of our global business strategy. We face competition in forming and maintaining these commercial relationships since there are a limited number of potential arrangements and other airlines are looking to enter into similar relationships, and our inability to form or maintain these relationships or inability to form as many of these relationships as our competitors may have an adverse effect on our business. Any such existing or future investment could involve significant challenges and risks, including that we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment or that they may not generate the expected revenue synergies. These events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.If our financial condition worsens, provisions in our credit card processing and other commercial agreements may adversely affect our liquidity.We have agreements with companies that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services. These agreements allow these credit card processing companies, under certain conditions (including, with respect to certain agreements, our failure to maintain certain levels of liquidity), to hold an amount of our cash (a holdback) equal to some or all of the advance ticket sales that have been processed by that credit card processor, but for which we have not yet provided the air transportation. These credit card processing companies are not currently entitled to maintain any holdbacks pursuant to these requirements. These holdback requirements can be modified at the discretion of the credit card processing companies upon the occurrence of specific events, including material adverse changes in our financial condition. The imposition of holdback requirements, up to and including 100% of relevant advanced ticket sales, would materially reduce our liquidity. Likewise, other of our commercial agreements contain provisions that allow other entities to impose less-favorable terms, including the acceleration of amounts due, in the event of material adverse changes in our financial condition.We have a significant amount of goodwill, which is assessed for impairment at least annually. In addition, we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets or long-lived assets, causing us to record material impairment charges.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are assessed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. In addition, we are required to assess certain of our other long-lived assets for impairment if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred.33Future impairment of goodwill or other long-lived assets could be recorded in results of operations as a result of changes in assumptions, estimates, or circumstances, some of which are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that a material impairment charge of goodwill or tangible or intangible assets will be avoided. The value of our aircraft could be impacted in future periods by changes in supply and demand for these aircraft. Such changes in supply and demand for certain aircraft types could result from grounding of aircraft by us or other airlines. An impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.The price of AAG common stock has been and may in the future be volatile.The market price of AAG common stock has fluctuated in the past, and may fluctuate substantially in the future, due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:•macro-economic conditions, including the price of fuel;•changes in market values of airline companies as well as general market conditions;•our operating and financial results failing to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors;•changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;•changes in our level of outstanding indebtedness and other obligations;•changes in our credit ratings;•material announcements by us or our competitors;•expectations regarding our capital deployment program, including any existing or potential future share repurchase programs and any future dividend payments that may be declared by our Board of Directors, or any determination to cease repurchasing stock or paying dividends;•new regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines;•general and industry-specific economic conditions;•changes in our key personnel;•public sales of a substantial number of shares of AAG common stock or issuances of AAG common stock upon the exercise or conversion of restricted stock unit awards, stock appreciation rights, or other securities that may be issued from time to time;•increases or decreases in reported holdings by insiders or other significant stockholders; and•fluctuations in trading volume.We cannot guarantee that we will continue to repurchase our common stock or pay dividends on our common stock or that our capital deployment program will enhance long-term stockholder value. Our capital deployment program could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and diminish our cash reserves.Since July 2014, as part of our capital deployment program, our Board of Directors has approved seven share repurchase programs aggregating $13.0 billion of authority. As of December\\xa031, 2019, there was $565 million of remaining authority to repurchase shares under our current $2.0 billion share repurchase program. Share repurchases under our repurchase programs may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions. These share repurchase programs do not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares or to repurchase any specific number of shares for any fixed period, and may be suspended at any time at our discretion and without prior notice. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, will be subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. Our repurchase of AAG common stock may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without prior notice.34Our Board of Directors commenced declaring quarterly cash dividends in July 2014 as part of our capital deployment program. However, any future dividends that may be declared and paid from time to time will be subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. We are not obligated to continue a dividend for any fixed period, and the payment of dividends may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without prior notice. We will continue to retain future earnings to develop our business, as opportunities arise, and evaluate on a quarterly basis the amount and timing of future dividends based on our operating results, financial condition, capital requirements and general business conditions. The amount and timing of any future dividends may vary, and the payment of any dividend does not assure that we will pay dividends in the future.In addition, any future repurchases of AAG common stock or payment of dividends, or any determination to cease repurchasing stock or paying dividends, could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a share repurchase program and any future dividends could cause our stock price to be higher than it would otherwise be and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Additionally, any future repurchases of AAG common stock or payment of dividends will diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions. Further, our repurchase of AAG common stock may fluctuate such that our cash flow may be insufficient to fully cover our share repurchases. Although our share repurchase programs are intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance that they will do so. AAG’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws include provisions that limit voting and acquisition and disposition of our equity interests.Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws include significant provisions that limit voting and ownership and disposition of our equity interests, as described in Part II, Item 5. Market for American Airlines Group’s Common Stock, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - “Ownership Restrictions” and AAG’s Description of the Registrants’ Securities Registered Pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which is filed as Exhibit 4.1 hereto. These restrictions may adversely affect the ability of certain holders of AAG common stock and our other equity interests to vote such interests and adversely affect the ability of persons to acquire shares of AAG common stock and our other equity interests.Certain provisions of AAG’s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our Board of Directors and may discourage takeover attempts that some of our stockholders might consider beneficial.Certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, as currently in effect, may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our Board of Directors determines that such changes in control are not in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders. These provisions include, among other things, the following:•advance notice procedures for stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholders’ meetings;•the ability of our Board of Directors to fill vacancies on the board;•a prohibition against stockholders taking action by written consent;•stockholders are restricted from calling a special meeting unless they hold at least 20% of our outstanding shares and follow the procedures provided for in the amended Bylaws;•a requirement that holders of at least 80% of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors approve any amendment of our Bylaws submitted to stockholders for approval;\\xa0and•super-majority voting requirements to modify or amend specified provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation.These provisions are not intended to prevent a takeover, but are intended to protect and maximize the value of the interests of our stockholders. While these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of our company to negotiate with our Board of Directors, they could enable our Board of Directors to prevent a transaction that some, or a majority, of our stockholders might believe to be in their best interest and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section\\xa0203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits business combinations with interested stockholders. Interested stockholders do not include stockholders whose acquisition of our securities is approved by the Board of Directors prior to the investment under Section\\xa0203.35ITEM\\xa01B.\\xa0UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSWe had no unresolved Securities and Exchange Commission staff comments that were issued 180 days or more preceding December\\xa031, 2019.36ITEM\\xa02. PROPERTIESFlight Equipment and Fleet RenewalAs of December\\xa031, 2019, American operated a mainline fleet of 942 aircraft. In 2019, we continued our extensive fleet renewal program, which has provided us with the youngest fleet of the major U.S. network carriers. During 2019, American took delivery of 24 mainline aircraft and retired 38 mainline aircraft. We are supported by our wholly-owned and third-party regional carriers that fly under capacity purchase agreements operating as American Eagle. As of December\\xa031, 2019, American Eagle operated 605 regional aircraft. During 2019, we increased our regional fleet by a net of ten aircraft, including the addition of 46 regional aircraft and retirement of 36 regional aircraft.

Actual delivery dates are subject to change based on many potential factors including production delays by the manufacturer. (2)\\xa0In October 2019, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative announced a 10% tariff on new Airbus aircraft imported from Europe. Effective March 18, 2020, this tariff rate will increase to 15%. We are evaluating the impact of this tariff on our future Airbus deliveries. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - “We operate a global business with international operations that are subject to economic and political instability and have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control.”(3)\\xa0On March 13, 2019, a directive from the FAA grounded all U.S.-registered Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. We currently have 76 Boeing 737 MAX Family aircraft on order and we have not taken delivery of any Boeing 737 MAX Family aircraft since the grounding. The extent of the delay to the scheduled deliveries of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft included in the table above is expected to be impacted by the length of time the FAA order remains in place, Boeing's production rate and the pace at which Boeing can deliver aircraft following the lifting of the FAA order, among other factors. The above table reflects our estimate of future Boeing 737 MAX aircraft deliveries based on information currently available to us; however, the actual delivery schedule may differ from the table above, potentially materially.We also have agreements for 34 spare engines to be delivered in 2020 and beyond.We currently have financing commitments in place for all aircraft on order and scheduled to be delivered through May 2020. Our ability to draw on the financing commitments we have in place is subject to the satisfaction of various terms and conditions, including in some cases, on our acquisition of the aircraft by a certain date. We do not have financing commitments in place for four aircraft scheduled to be delivered in 2020: two Airbus A320neo Family aircraft and two Boeing 737 MAX Family aircraft. We also do not have financing commitments in place for any of the aircraft scheduled to be delivered beyond 2020, except for 10 Boeing 787 Family aircraft scheduled to be delivered in 2021. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\\xa0–“We will need to obtain sufficient financing or other capital to operate successfully” for additional discussion.See Note 12 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item\\xa08A and Note 10 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item\\xa08B for additional information on aircraft and engine acquisition commitments.39Ground PropertiesAt each airport where we conduct flight operations, we have agreements, generally with a governmental unit or authority, for the use of passenger, operations and baggage handling space as well as runways and taxiways. These agreements, particularly in the U.S., often contain provisions for periodic adjustments to rates and charges applicable under such agreements. These rates and charges also vary with our level of operations and the operations of the airport. Additionally, at our hub locations and in certain other cities we serve, we lease administrative offices, catering, cargo, training, maintenance and other facilities.We lease or have built on leased property our headquarters and training facilities in Fort Worth, Texas, our principal overhaul and maintenance base in Tulsa, Oklahoma, our regional reservation offices, and administrative offices throughout the U.S. and abroad. Construction was completed in 2019 on our new headquarters on the corporate campus in Fort Worth, Texas.ITEM\\xa03.\\xa0\\xa0LEGAL PROCEEDINGSChapter 11 Cases. On November\\xa029, 2011, AMR, American, and certain of AMR’s other direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries (the Debtors) filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). On October\\xa021, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving and confirming the Debtors’ fourth amended joint plan of reorganization (as amended, the Plan). On the Effective Date, December\\xa09, 2013, the Debtors consummated their reorganization pursuant to the Plan and completed the Merger.Pursuant to rulings of the Bankruptcy Court, the Plan established the Disputed Claims Reserve to hold shares of AAG common stock reserved for issuance to disputed claimholders at the Effective Date that ultimately become holders of allowed claims. The shares of AAG common stock issued to the Disputed Claims Reserve were originally issued on December\\xa013, 2013 and have at all times since been included in the number of shares issued and outstanding as reported from time to time in our quarterly and annual reports, including for purposes of calculating earnings per common share. As disputed claims are resolved, the claimants receive distributions of shares from the Disputed Claims Reserve. However, we are not required to distribute additional shares above the limits contemplated by the Plan, even if the shares remaining for distribution in the Disputed Claims Reserve are not sufficient to fully pay any additional allowed unsecured claims. To the extent that any of the reserved shares remain undistributed upon resolution of all remaining disputed claims, such shares will not be returned to us but rather will be distributed to former AMR stockholders and former convertible noteholders treated as stockholders under the Plan. As of December\\xa031, 2019, the Disputed Claims Reserve held approximately 7 million shares of AAG common stock.Private Party Antitrust Action Related to Passenger Capacity. We, along with Delta Air Lines, Inc., Southwest Airlines Co., United Airlines, Inc. and, in the case of litigation filed in Canada, Air Canada, were named as defendants in approximately 100 putative class action lawsuits alleging unlawful agreements with respect to air passenger capacity. The U.S. lawsuits were consolidated in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia (the DC Court). On June 15, 2018, we reached a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs in the amount of $45 million to resolve all class claims in the U.S. lawsuits. That settlement was approved by the DC Court on May 13, 2019. Three parties who objected to the settlement have appealed that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. We believe these appeals are without merit and intend to vigorously defend against them. Private Party Antitrust Action Related to the Merger. On August\\xa06, 2013, a lawsuit captioned Carolyn Fjord, et al., v. AMR Corporation, et al., was filed in the Bankruptcy Court. The complaint named as defendants US Airways Group, US Airways, AMR and American, alleged that the effect of the Merger may be to create a monopoly in violation of Section\\xa07 of the Clayton Antitrust Act, and sought injunctive relief and/or divestiture. On November\\xa027, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court denied plaintiffs’ motion to preliminarily enjoin the Merger. On August 29, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court denied in part defendants' motion for summary judgment, and fully denied plaintiffs' cross-motion for summary judgment. The parties' evidentiary cases were presented before the Bankruptcy Court in a bench trial in March 2019. The parties submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law and made closing arguments in April 2019, and we are awaiting the Bankruptcy Court's decision. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend against the allegations.Pension Benefits Action. On December 11, 2018, a lawsuit captioned Torres, et al. v. American Airlines, Inc., The Employee Benefits Committee and John/Jane Does 1-5, was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas.  The plaintiffs in this lawsuit purport to represent a class consisting of all participants in and beneficiaries under any of the four American defined benefit pension plans who elected to receive an optional form of benefit other than a lump sum distribution of a participant’s vested benefit. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), participants 40covered by defined benefit plans accrue retirement benefits in the form of a single life annuity payable upon retirement on a monthly basis until the employee’s death, and may elect certain alternative forms of benefit payments. Plaintiffs contend that the mortality tables used by American for purposes of calculations related to these alternative forms of benefits are outdated and that more recent mortality tables would have provided more generous benefits and should have been used to make those calculations. The court has denied our motion to dismiss the complaint. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend against the allegations.General. In addition to the specifically identified legal proceedings, we and our subsidiaries are also engaged in other legal proceedings from time to time.\\xa0Legal proceedings can be complex and take many months, or even years, to reach resolution, with the final outcome depending on a number of variables, some of which are not within our control. Therefore, although we will vigorously defend ourselves in each of the actions described above and such other legal proceedings, their ultimate resolution and potential financial and other impacts on us are uncertain but could be material. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\\xa0–“We may be a party to litigation in the normal course of business or otherwise, which could affect our financial position and liquidity” for additional discussion.ITEM\\xa04.\\xa0\\xa0MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURESNot Applicable.41PART IIITEM\\xa05.MARKET FOR AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP’S COMMON STOCK, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIESStock Exchange ListingOur common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “AAL.” There is no trading market for the common stock of American, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAG.As of February\\xa014, 2020, the closing price of our common stock was $29.20 and there were 12,995 holders of record. However, because many of the shares of our common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we believe there are substantially more beneficial holders of our common stock than record holders. Information on securities authorized for issuance under our equity compensation plans will be set forth in our Proxy Statement for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of American Airlines Group Inc. (the Proxy Statement) under the caption “Equity Compensation Plan Information” and is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Dividends on Common StockIn January 2020, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a $0.10 per share cash dividend for stockholders of record on February\\xa05, 2020, and payable on February\\xa019, 2020.The total cash payment for dividends during the years ended December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018 was $178 million\\xa0and $186 million, respectively. Any future dividends that may be declared and paid from time to time will be subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. We are not obligated to continue a dividend for any fixed period, and the payment of dividends may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without prior notice.Stock Performance GraphThe following stock performance graph and related information shall not be deemed “soliciting material” or “filed” with the Securities and Exchange Commission, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any future filings under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, each as amended, except to the extent that we specifically incorporate it by reference into such filing.The following stock performance graph compares the cumulative total stockholder returns during the period from December 31, 2014 to December\\xa031, 2019 of our common stock to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) ARCA Airline Index and the Standard and Poor’s (S&P) 500 Stock Index.

The 2017 and 2016 financial information presented within Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data has been recast to reflect the impact of the adoption of the New Revenue Standard and the New Retirement Standard. The New Lease Standard did not require the recast of prior periods.

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures may also provide useful information to investors and others. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures of other companies, and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance, cash flow or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. We are providing a reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable financial measures on a GAAP basis.45The following table presents the components of our total net special items and the reconciliation of pre-tax income and net income (GAAP measures) to pre-tax income excluding net special items and net income excluding net special items (non-GAAP measures). Management uses pre-tax income excluding net special items and net income excluding net special items to evaluate our current operating performance and to allow for period-to-period comparisons. As net special items may vary from period-to-period in nature and amount, the adjustment to exclude net special items allows management an additional tool to understand our core operating performance.\\xa0Year Ended December\\xa031,\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa0(In millions)Components of Total Special Items, Net:\\xa0(1)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Fleet restructuring expenses (2)$271\\xa0$422Fleet impairment (3)213\\xa0—Merger integration expenses (4)191\\xa0268Litigation reserve adjustments(53)\\xa045Mark-to-market adjustments on bankruptcy obligations, net (5)(11)\\xa0(76)Severance expenses (6)11\\xa058Intangible asset impairment (7)—\\xa026Labor contract expenses—\\xa013Other operating charges, net13\\xa031Mainline operating special items, net635\\xa0787Regional operating special items, net6\\xa06Operating special items, net641\\xa0793Debt refinancing and extinguishment charges16\\xa013Mark-to-market adjustments on equity and other investments, net (8)(5)\\xa0104Other nonoperating income, net(8)\\xa0(4)Nonoperating special items, net3\\xa0113Pre-tax special items, net644\\xa0906Income tax special items, net (9)—\\xa018Total special items, net$644\\xa0$924\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Reconciliation of Pre-Tax Income Excluding Net Special Items:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Pre-tax income\\xa0–\\xa0GAAP$2,256\\xa0$1,884Adjusted for: Pre-tax special items, net644\\xa0906Pre-tax income excluding net special items$2,900\\xa0$2,790\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Reconciliation of Net Income Excluding Net Special Items:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Net income\\xa0–\\xa0GAAP$1,686\\xa0$1,412Adjusted for: Total special items, net644\\xa0924Adjusted for: Net tax effect of net special items(151)\\xa0(219)Net income excluding net special items$2,179\\xa0$2,117\\xa0(1)\\xa0See Note 2 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for further information on net special items.(2)\\xa0Fleet restructuring expenses principally included accelerated depreciation and rent expense for aircraft and related equipment grounded or expected to be grounded earlier than planned.(3)\\xa0Fleet impairment principally includes a non-cash write-down of aircraft related to the planned retirement of our Embraer E190 fleet.46(4)\\xa0Merger integration expenses included costs associated with integration projects, principally our technical operations, flight attendant, human resources and payroll systems.(5)\\xa0Bankruptcy obligations that will be settled in shares of our common stock are marked-to-market based on our stock price.

Management uses total operating costs excluding net special items and fuel to evaluate our current operating performance and for period-to-period comparisons. The price of fuel, over which we have no control, impacts the comparability of period-to-period financial performance. The adjustment to exclude aircraft fuel and net special items allows management an additional tool to understand and analyze our non-fuel costs and core operating performance.

In 2019, approximately 215 million\\xa0passengers boarded our flights.2019 Financial Overview AAG’s 2019 ResultsThe selected financial data presented below is derived from AAG’s audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8A of this report and should be read in conjunction with those financial statements and the related notes thereto.\\xa0Year EndedDecember\\xa031,\\xa0Increase(Decrease)\\xa0PercentIncrease(Decrease)\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa0\\xa0(In millions, except percentage changes)Passenger revenue$42,010\\xa0$40,676\\xa0$1,334\\xa03.3Cargo revenue863\\xa01,013\\xa0(150)\\xa0(14.8)Other operating revenue2,895\\xa02,852\\xa043\\xa01.5Total operating revenues45,768\\xa044,541\\xa01,227\\xa02.8Mainline and regional aircraft fuel and related taxes9,395\\xa09,896\\xa0(501)\\xa0(5.1)Salaries, wages and benefits12,609\\xa012,251\\xa0358\\xa02.9Total operating expenses42,703\\xa041,885\\xa0818\\xa02.0Operating income3,065\\xa02,656\\xa0409\\xa015.4Pre-tax income2,256\\xa01,884\\xa0372\\xa019.7Income tax provision570\\xa0472\\xa098\\xa020.7Net income1,686\\xa01,412\\xa0274\\xa019.4\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Pre-tax income – GAAP$2,256\\xa0$1,884\\xa0$372\\xa019.7Adjusted for: Pre-tax net special items (1)644\\xa0906\\xa0(262)\\xa0(28.9)Pre-tax income excluding net special items$2,900\\xa0$2,790\\xa0$110\\xa03.9\\xa0(1)\\xa0See Part II, Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data – “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and Note 2 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for details on the components of net special items.Pre-Tax Income and Net IncomePre-tax income and net income were $2.3 billion and $1.7 billion in 2019, respectively. This compares to 2018 pre-tax income and net income of $1.9 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. Excluding the effects of pre-tax net special items, pre-tax income was $2.9 billion and $2.8 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The year-over-year increase in our pre-tax income on both a GAAP basis and excluding pre-tax net special items was principally driven by higher revenues and lower fuel costs, offset in part by increases in salaries, wages and benefits, maintenance expenses and costs associated with increased regional capacity.49Fleet and OperationBoeing 737 MAXOn March 13, 2019, a directive from the FAA grounded all U.S.-registered Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. Our fleet currently includes 24 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft with an additional 76 aircraft on order. As a result of this directive, we canceled approximately 27,600 flights in 2019. We have removed all Boeing 737 MAX flying from our flight schedule through August 17, 2020 and continue to assess this timeline.Our estimate of the financial damages incurred in 2019 due to the Boeing 737 MAX grounding and related cancellations was approximately $540 million.As previously announced in January 2020, we reached a confidential agreement with Boeing on compensation related to financial damages incurred in 2019 due to the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. The settlement did not have a material impact on 2019 earnings because we are accounting for substantially all of the compensation as a reduction in cost basis of grounded Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and certain future Boeing 737 MAX aircraft deliveries. Our future aircraft purchase commitments in Note 12 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item\\xa08A reflect the portion of the compensation we expect to receive in the future as Boeing 737 MAX aircraft are delivered. These amounts reflect our best estimate in light of the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future Boeing 737 MAX aircraft deliveries.Due to the impact of the Boeing 737 MAX grounding on our 2019 financial results, our Board of Directors authorized a discretionary portion of the settlement to be returned to team members through our 2019 profit-sharing program. The profit-sharing award was based on our estimate of full-year 2019 financial damages for the Boeing 737 MAX grounding. As a result, an additional accrual of approximately $30 million was made to our 2019 profit-sharing program.We are pleased with the settlement agreement we reached for 2019, which was intended to address our financial damages incurred in 2019 due to the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. However, the aircraft remain grounded and therefore we continue to incur financial damages in 2020. We expect discussions to continue with Boeing for further compensation for these damages.Operational SlowdownIn 2019, the TWU-IAM Association engaged in an illegal work slowdown in an effort to influence contract negotiations. This slowdown significantly impacted our operation and caused a significant number of flight cancellations and delays in the second and third quarters of 2019. Agreements in principle were reached on January 30, 2020 for JCBAs covering all of the workgroups represented by the TWU-IAM Association. Those agreements are subject to membership ratification vote. RevenueIn 2019, we reported total operating revenues of $45.8 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 2.8%, as compared to 2018. Passenger revenue was $42.0 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion, or 3.3%, as compared to 2018. The increase in passenger revenue in 2019 was due to continued strength in passenger demand resulting in a 4.4% increase in revenue passenger miles (RPMs) and a 2.6 point increase in passenger load factor. Domestic passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) increased 2.0% as compared to 2018. Latin America was the best performing international region in 2019, with PRASM increasing 3.4% followed by Pacific with PRASM increasing 3.1%, while Atlantic PRASM declined 1.5% principally due to lower transfer payments related to our joint business arrangement and foreign currency effects.In 2019, cargo revenue was $863 million, a decrease of $150 million, or 14.8%, as compared to 2018, primarily due to a 14.4% decrease in cargo ton miles reflecting declines in freight volumes, principally as a result of international schedule reductions. Other operating revenue increased $43 million, or 1.5%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, principally driven by higher revenue associated with our airport clubs and loyalty program.Our total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) was 16.05 cents in 2019, a 1.7% increase as compared to 15.79 cents in 2018. FuelOur mainline and regional fuel expense totaled $9.4 billion in 2019, which was $501 million, or 5.1%, lower compared to 2018. This decrease was primarily driven by a 6.9% decrease in the average price per gallon of fuel including related taxes to $2.07 in 2019 from $2.23 in 2018, offset in part by a 2.0% increase in gallons of fuel consumed.50As of December\\xa031, 2019, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding to hedge our fuel consumption. Our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, although we review that policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors. As such, and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices.Other CostsWe remain committed to actively managing our cost structure, which we believe is necessary in an industry whose economic prospects are heavily dependent upon two variables we cannot control: the health of the economy and the price of fuel.Our 2019 total cost per available seat mile (CASM) was 14.98 cents, an increase of 0.9%, from 14.85 cents in 2018. Our 2019 CASM excluding net special items and fuel was 11.46 cents, an increase of 3.6%, from 11.06 cents in 2018. The increase was primarily driven by higher maintenance expenses, costs associated with increased regional capacity and lower than planned capacity in 2019 due to the Boeing 737 MAX grounding.For a reconciliation of CASM excluding net special items and fuel, see Part II, Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data\\xa0– “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”LiquidityAs of December\\xa031, 2019, we had approximately $7.0 billion in total available liquidity, consisting of $3.8 billion in unrestricted cash and short-term investments and $3.2 billion in undrawn capacity under our revolving credit facilities. We also had restricted cash and short-term investments of $158 million. During 2019, we completed the following significant financing transactions:•raised $3.2 billion from enhanced equipment trust certificates (EETCs) and other aircraft and flight equipment financing, of which $1.3 billion was used to repay existing indebtedness; •issued $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.000% senior notes due 2022 (the 5.000% senior notes);•raised $850 million from aircraft sale-leaseback transactions; and•extended the maturities on $2.8 billion of our revolving credit facility commitments by one year from 2023 to 2024, and due to uncertainty surrounding the timing of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft return to service, entered into an additional $400 million short-term revolving line of credit. See Note 5 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information on our debt obligations.Additionally, we returned $1.3 billion to our stockholders in 2019, including the repurchase of $1.1 billion of our common stock, or 33.8 million shares, and quarterly dividend payments totaling $178 million. Since our capital return program commenced in mid-2014, we have returned $13.6 billion to stockholders, including $12.4 billion in share repurchases, or 312.7 million shares, and $1.2 billion in quarterly dividend payments.51AAG’s Results of OperationsFor a comparison of the 2018 to 2017 reporting periods, see Part II, Item 7.

Latin America was the best performing international region in 2019, with PRASM increasing 3.4% followed by Pacific with PRASM increasing 3.1%, while Atlantic PRASM declined 1.5% principally due to lower transfer payments related to our joint business arrangement and foreign currency effects.Cargo revenue decreased $150 million, or 14.8%, in 2019 from 2018 primarily due to a 14.4% decrease in cargo ton miles reflecting declines in international freight volumes, principally as a result of international schedule reductions.Other operating revenue increased $43 million, or 1.5%, in 2019 from 2018 primarily due to higher revenue associated with our airport clubs and loyalty program.Total operating revenues in 2019 increased $1.2 billion, or 2.8%, from 2018 driven principally by a 3.3% increase in passenger revenue as described above.

See detailed explanations below relating to changes in total CASM.Total CASMWe sometimes use financial measures that are derived from the consolidated financial statements but that are not presented in accordance with GAAP to understand and evaluate our current operating performance and to allow for period-to-period comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures may also provide useful information to investors and others. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures of other companies, and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance, 53cash flow or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. We are providing a reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable financial measures on a GAAP basis.The table below presents the reconciliation of total operating expenses (GAAP measure) to total operating costs excluding net special items and fuel (non-GAAP measure). Management uses total operating costs excluding net special items and fuel to evaluate our current operating performance and for period-to-period comparisons. The price of fuel, over which we have no control, impacts the comparability of period-to-period financial performance. The adjustment to exclude aircraft fuel and net special items allows management an additional tool to understand and analyze our non-fuel costs and core operating performance.The major components of our total CASM and our total CASM excluding net special items and fuel for the years ended December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018 are as follows (amounts may not recalculate due to rounding):\\xa0  Year\\xa0Ended\\xa0December\\xa031,\\xa0PercentIncrease(Decrease)\\xa0  2019\\xa02018\\xa0\\xa0(In cents, except percentage changes)Total CASM:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Aircraft fuel and related taxes2.64\\xa02.86\\xa0(7.5)Salaries, wages and benefits4.42\\xa04.34\\xa01.8Maintenance, materials and repairs0.83\\xa00.73\\xa014.9Other rent and landing fees0.72\\xa00.67\\xa07.0Aircraft rent0.47\\xa00.45\\xa03.8Selling expenses0.56\\xa00.54\\xa04.3Depreciation and amortization0.70\\xa00.65\\xa06.6Special items, net0.22\\xa00.28\\xa0(20.2)Other1.78\\xa01.80\\xa0(1.1)Regional expenses:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Aircraft fuel and related taxes0.66\\xa00.65\\xa00.3Other1.98\\xa01.88\\xa05.3Total CASM14.98\\xa014.85\\xa00.9Mainline operating special items, net(0.22)\\xa0(0.28)\\xa0(20.2)Aircraft fuel and related taxes\\xa0\\xa0Aircraft fuel and related taxes - mainline(2.64)\\xa0(2.86)\\xa0(7.5)Aircraft fuel and related taxes - regional(0.66)\\xa0(0.65)\\xa00.3Total CASM, excluding net special items and fuel11.46\\xa011.06\\xa03.6Significant changes in the components of total CASM are as follows:•Mainline aircraft fuel and related taxes per ASM decreased 7.5% in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to a 7.1% decrease in the average price per gallon of fuel including related taxes to $2.05 in 2019 from $2.21 in 2018.  •Maintenance, materials and repairs per ASM increased 14.9% in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to a contract change that resulted in certain flight equipment transitioning to a flight hour based contract (referred to as power by the hour) whereby expense is incurred and recognized based on actual hours flown. Previously, this flight equipment was covered by a time and materials based contract whereby expense is incurred and recognized as maintenance is performed. An increase in the volume of airframe and engine overhauls performed under time and material based contracts as well as an increase in the volume of component part repairs also drove higher maintenance expenses in 2019.•Other rent and landing fees per ASM increased 7.0% in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to an expansion at DFW that became fully operational in May 2019 and rate increases at certain hub airports.54•Depreciation and amortization per ASM increased 6.6% in 2019 as compared to 2018 due in part to airport and other facility improvements and the harmonization of interior configurations across the mainline fleet. Depreciation associated with aircraft acquired as part of our fleet renewal program also contributed to the increase.•Regional aircraft fuel and related taxes per ASM increased 0.3% in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to an 8.3% increase in gallons of fuel consumed, offset in part by a 6.4% decrease in the average price per gallon of fuel including related taxes to $2.15 in 2019 from $2.30 in 2018.•Regional other operating expenses per ASM increased 5.3% in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily driven by an 8.3% increase in regional capacity, principally from our wholly-owned regional carriers.Operating Special Items, Net\\xa0Year\\xa0Ended\\xa0December\\xa031,\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa0(In millions)Fleet restructuring expenses (1)$271\\xa0$422Fleet impairment (2)213\\xa0—Merger integration expenses (3)191\\xa0268Litigation reserve adjustments(53)\\xa045Mark-to-market adjustments on bankruptcy obligations, net (4)(11)\\xa0(76)Severance expenses (5)11\\xa058Intangible asset impairment (6)—\\xa026Labor contract expenses—\\xa013Other operating charges, net13\\xa031Total mainline operating special items, net635\\xa0787Regional operating special items, net6\\xa06Total operating special items, net$641\\xa0$793\\xa0(1)\\xa0Fleet restructuring expenses principally included accelerated depreciation and rent expense for aircraft and related equipment grounded or expected to be grounded earlier than planned.(2)\\xa0Fleet impairment principally includes a non-cash write-down of aircraft related to the planned retirement of our Embraer E190 fleet.(3)\\xa0Merger integration expenses included costs associated with integration projects, principally our technical operations, flight attendant, human resources and payroll systems.(4)\\xa0Bankruptcy obligations that will be settled in shares of our common stock are marked-to-market based on our stock price.(5)\\xa0Severance expenses primarily included costs associated with reductions of management and support staff team members.(6)\\xa0Intangible asset impairment includes a non-cash charge to write-off our Brazil route authority as a result of the U.S.-Brazil open skies agreement.55Nonoperating Results\\xa0\\xa0Year\\xa0Ended\\xa0December\\xa031,\\xa0Increase(Decrease)\\xa0PercentIncrease(Decrease)\\xa0\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa0\\xa0(In millions,\\xa0except\\xa0percentage\\xa0changes)Interest income$127\\xa0$118\\xa0$9\\xa07.1Interest expense, net(1,095)\\xa0(1,056)\\xa0(39)\\xa03.7Other income, net159\\xa0166\\xa0(7)\\xa0(3.8)Total nonoperating expense, net$(809)\\xa0$(772)\\xa0$(37)\\xa04.8Interest expense, net increased $39 million, or 3.7% in 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to lower capitalized interest.In 2019, other nonoperating income, net principally included $183 million of non-service related pension and other postretirement benefit plan income. This income was offset in part by $32 million of net foreign currency losses principally associated with losses from Latin American currencies.In 2018, other nonoperating income, net principally included $308 million of non-service related pension and other postretirement benefit plan income. This income was offset in part by a $104 million net special charge for mark-to-market unrealized losses primarily associated with our equity investment in China Southern Airlines and $55 million of net foreign currency losses from Latin American currencies.The decrease in non-service related pension and other postretirement benefit plan income in 2019 as compared to 2018 is principally due to a decrease in the expected return on pension plan assets.Income TaxesIn 2019, we recorded an income tax provision of $570 million at an effective rate of approximately 25%, which was substantially non-cash due to utilization of our net operating losses (NOLs). Substantially all of our income before income taxes is attributable to the United States. At December\\xa031, 2019, we had approximately $9.1 billion of federal NOLs and $3.0 billion of state NOLs, substantially all of which we expect to be available in 2020 to reduce future federal and state taxable income.In 2018, we recorded an income tax provision of $472 million at an effective rate of approximately 25%, which was substantially non-cash. This provision included an $18 million special income tax charge related to an international income tax matter.See Note 7 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for additional information on income taxes.American’s Results of OperationsFor a comparison of the 2018 to 2017 reporting periods, see Part II, Item 7.

Domestic PRASM increased in 2019 as compared to 2018. Latin America PRASM was the best performing international region in 2019, followed by Pacific PRASM, while Atlantic PRASM declined principally due to lower transfer payments related to American’s joint business arrangement and foreign currency effects. Cargo revenue decreased $150 million, or 14.8%, in 2019 from 2018 primarily due to a decrease in cargo ton miles reflecting declines in international freight volumes, principally as a result of international schedule reductions.Other operating revenue increased $47 million, or 1.7% in 2019 from 2018 primarily due to higher revenue associated with American’s airport clubs and loyalty program.Total operating revenues in 2019 increased $1.2 billion, or 2.8%, from 2018 driven principally by a 3.3% increase in passenger revenue as described above.Operating Expenses\\xa0\\xa0Year EndedDecember\\xa031,\\xa0Increase(Decrease)\\xa0PercentIncrease(Decrease)\\xa0\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa0\\xa0(In millions, except percentage changes)Aircraft fuel and related taxes$7,526\\xa0$8,053\\xa0$(527)\\xa0(6.5)Salaries, wages and benefits12,600\\xa012,240\\xa0360\\xa02.9Maintenance, materials and repairs2,380\\xa02,050\\xa0330\\xa016.1Other rent and landing fees2,055\\xa01,900\\xa0155\\xa08.2Aircraft rent1,326\\xa01,264\\xa062\\xa04.9Selling expenses1,602\\xa01,520\\xa082\\xa05.4Depreciation and amortization1,982\\xa01,839\\xa0143\\xa07.7Mainline operating special items, net635\\xa0787\\xa0(152)\\xa0(19.4)Other5,090\\xa05,090\\xa0—\\xa0—Regional expenses:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Aircraft fuel and related taxes1,869\\xa01,843\\xa026\\xa01.4Other5,649\\xa05,221\\xa0428\\xa08.2Total operating expenses$42,714\\xa0$41,807\\xa0$907\\xa02.2Total operating expenses increased $907 million, or 2.2%, in 2019 from 2018. Significant changes in the components of American’s total operating expenses are as follows:•Mainline aircraft fuel and related taxes decreased 6.5% in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to a 7.1% decrease in the average price per gallon of fuel including related taxes to $2.05 in 2019 from $2.21 in 2018. •Maintenance, materials and repairs increased 16.1% in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to a contract change that resulted in certain flight equipment transitioning to a flight hour based contract (referred to as power by the hour) whereby expense is incurred and recognized based on actual hours flown.

Depreciation associated with aircraft acquired as part of American’s fleet renewal program also contributed to the increase. 57•Regional aircraft fuel and related taxes increased 1.4% in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily due to an 8.3% increase in gallons of fuel consumed, offset in part by a 6.4% decrease in the average price per gallon of fuel including related taxes to $2.15 in 2019 from $2.30 in 2018.•Regional other operating expenses increased 8.2% in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily driven by an increase in regional capacity.Operating Special Items, Net\\xa0Year\\xa0Ended\\xa0December\\xa031,2019\\xa02018\\xa0(In millions)Fleet restructuring expenses (1)$271\\xa0$422Fleet impairment (2)213\\xa0—Merger integration expenses (3)191\\xa0268Litigation reserve adjustments(53)\\xa045Mark-to-market adjustments on bankruptcy obligations, net (4)(11)\\xa0(76)Severance expenses (5)11\\xa058Intangible asset impairment (6)—\\xa026Labor contract expenses—\\xa013Other operating charges, net13\\xa031Total mainline operating special items, net$635\\xa0$787(1)\\xa0Fleet restructuring expenses principally included accelerated depreciation and rent expense for aircraft and related equipment grounded or expected to be grounded earlier than planned.(2)\\xa0Fleet impairment principally includes a non-cash write-down of aircraft related to the planned retirement of American's Embraer E190 fleet.(3)\\xa0Merger integration expenses included costs associated with integration projects, principally American's technical operations, flight attendant, human resources and payroll systems.(4)\\xa0Bankruptcy obligations that will be settled in shares of AAG common stock are marked-to-market based on AAG’s stock price.(5)\\xa0Severance expenses primarily included costs associated with reductions of management and support staff team members.(6)\\xa0Intangible asset impairment includes a non-cash charge to write-off American’s Brazil route authority as a result of the U.S.-Brazil open skies agreement.Nonoperating Results\\xa0\\xa0Year\\xa0EndedDecember\\xa031,\\xa0Increase(Decrease)\\xa0PercentIncrease(Decrease)\\xa0\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa0\\xa0(In millions, except percentage changes)Interest income$515\\xa0$330\\xa0$185\\xa056.1Interest expense, net(1,109)\\xa0(1,028)\\xa0(81)\\xa07.8Other income, net152\\xa0167\\xa0(15)\\xa0(9.3)Total nonoperating expense, net$(442)\\xa0$(531)\\xa0$89\\xa0(16.9)Interest income increased $185 million, or 56.1%, due to higher interest-bearing related party receivables from American’s parent company, AAG in 2019 as compared to 2018.58Interest expense, net increased $81 million, or 7.8%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, primarily due to higher-interest bearing related party payables to other AAG subsidiaries and lower capitalized interest.In 2019, other nonoperating income, net principally included $183 million of non-service related pension and other postretirement benefit plan income. This income was offset in part by $32 million of net foreign currency losses principally associated with losses from Latin American currencies.In 2018, other nonoperating income, net principally included $309 million of non-service related pension and other postretirement benefit plan income. This income was offset in part by a $104 million net special charge for mark-to-market unrealized losses primarily associated with American’s equity investment in China Southern Airlines and $54 million of net foreign currency losses from Latin American currencies.The decrease in non-service related pension and other postretirement benefit plan income in 2019 as compared to 2018 is principally due to a decrease in the expected return on pension plan assets.Income TaxesAmerican is part of the AAG consolidated income tax return.In 2019, American recorded an income tax provision of $633 million at an effective rate of approximately 24%, which was substantially non-cash due to utilization of its NOLs. Substantially all of American’s income before income taxes is attributable to the United States. At December\\xa031, 2019, American had approximately $9.2 billion of federal NOLs and $2.9 billion of state NOLs, substantially all of which American expects to be available in 2020 to reduce future federal and state taxable income.In 2018, American recorded an income tax provision of $534 million at an effective rate of approximately 24%, which was substantially non-cash. This provision included an $18 million special income tax charge related to an international income tax matter.See Note 5 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information on income taxes.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesLiquidityAs of December\\xa031, 2019, AAG had approximately $7.0 billion in total available liquidity and $158 million in restricted cash and short-term investments.

We have no present intention to borrow any amounts under this facility, which matures in September 2020 with an optional extension to December 2020. For additional discussion of this facility see Note 5 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 3 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B.59Share Repurchase ProgramsIn April 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a $2.0 billion share repurchase program that will expire on December 31, 2020. Since July 2014, our Board of Directors has approved seven share repurchase programs aggregating $13.0 billion of authority. As of December\\xa031, 2019, there was $565 million of remaining authority to repurchase shares under our current $2.0 billion share repurchase program. Share repurchases under our repurchase programs may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions. Any such repurchases that may be made from time to time will be subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares and our repurchase of AAG common stock may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without prior notice.In 2019, we repurchased 33.8 million shares of AAG common stock for $1.1 billion at a weighted average cost per share of $32.09. Since the inception of our share repurchase programs in July 2014 through December 31, 2019, we have repurchased 312.7 million shares of AAG common stock for $12.4 billion at a weighted average cost per share of $39.76.Cash DividendsOur Board of Directors declared the following cash dividends during 2019:Period\\xa0Per share\\xa0For stockholders of record as of\\xa0Payable on\\xa0Total (millions)First Quarter\\xa0$0.10\\xa0February\\xa06, 2019\\xa0February 20, 2019\\xa0$46Second Quarter\\xa00.10\\xa0May 8, 2019\\xa0May 22, 2019\\xa044Third Quarter\\xa00.10\\xa0August 7, 2019\\xa0August 21, 2019\\xa044Fourth Quarter\\xa00.10\\xa0November 6, 2019\\xa0November 20, 2019\\xa044Total\\xa0$0.40\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$178In January 2020, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a $0.10 per share cash dividend for stockholders of record on February\\xa05, 2020, and payable on February\\xa019, 2020.Any future dividends that may be declared and paid from time to time will be subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. We are not obligated to continue a dividend for any fixed period, and the payment of dividends may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without prior notice.Collateral-Related CovenantsCertain of our debt financing agreements (including our term loans, revolving credit facilities and spare engine EETCs) contain loan to value ratio covenants and require us to appraise the related collateral annually. Pursuant to such agreements, if the loan to value ratio exceeds a specified threshold or the value of the appraised collateral fails to meet a specified threshold, as the case may be, we are required, as applicable, to pledge additional qualifying collateral (which in some cases may include cash or investment securities), or pay down such financing, in whole or in part. As of December\\xa031, 2019, we were in compliance with the foregoing collateral coverage tests as of the most recent applicable measurement dates. For further information regarding our collateral-related covenants, see Note 5 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 3 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B.Sources and Uses of CashFor a comparison of the 2018 and 2017 reporting periods, see Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – “Sources and Uses of Cash” of our 2018 Form 10-K.AAG2019 Compared to 2018 Operating ActivitiesOur net cash provided by operating activities was $3.8 billion and $3.5 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively, a year-over-year increase of $282 million. This increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to higher profitability in 2019 as well as working capital increases principally in our air traffic liability and loyalty program deferred revenue. These increases were offset in part by higher contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2019 as compared to 2018.60Investing ActivitiesOur net cash used in investing activities was $2.2 billion and $2.0 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively.Our principal investing activities in 2019 included expenditures of $4.3 billion for property and equipment, including 21 Embraer E175 aircraft, 12 Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft, 12 Airbus A321neo aircraft, four Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and two Boeing 787 Family aircraft. These cash outflows were offset in part by $960 million in net sales of short-term investments, $850 million of proceeds from aircraft sale-leaseback transactions and $250 million in proceeds from a vendor.Our principal investing activities in 2018 included expenditures of $3.7 billion for property and equipment, including 16 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, six Boeing 787 family aircraft and five Embraer E175 aircraft. These cash outflows were offset in part by $1.1 billion of proceeds from aircraft sale-leaseback transactions and $293 million in net sales of short-term investments.Financing ActivitiesOur net cash used in financing activities was $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively.Our principal financing activities in 2019 included $4.2 billion in debt repayments, consisting of $2.9 billion in scheduled debt repayments and the prepayment of $1.3 billion of secured loans. We also had $1.1 billion in share repurchases and $178 million in dividend payments. These cash outflows were offset in part by $4.0 billion in proceeds from the issuance of debt, consisting of $3.2 billion in connection with the issuance of equipment notes related to EETCs and the financing of certain aircraft and other flight equipment, as well as the issuance of $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.000% senior notes.Our principal financing activities in 2018 included $2.9 billion in debt repayments, consisting of $2.4 billion in scheduled debt repayments and the prepayment of $513 million of secured loans. We also had $837 million in share repurchases and $186 million in dividend payments. These cash outflows were offset in part by $2.4 billion in proceeds from the issuance of debt, consisting of $1.9 billion in connection with the issuance of equipment notes related to EETCs and the financing of certain aircraft and pre-delivery purchase deposits, as well as an incremental $500 million on a term loan facility.American2019 Compared to 2018Operating ActivitiesAmerican’s net cash provided by operating activities was $2.4 billion and $1.9 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively, a year-over-year increase of $486 million. This increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to higher profitability in 2019 as well as working capital increases principally in American's air traffic liability and loyalty program deferred revenue. These increases were offset in part by higher contributions to American's defined benefit pension plans in 2019 as compared to 2018.Investing ActivitiesAmerican’s net cash used in investing activities was $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively.American’s principal investing activities in 2019 included expenditures of $4.2 billion for property and equipment, including 21 Embraer E175 aircraft, 12 Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft, 12 Airbus A321neo aircraft, four Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and two Boeing 787 Family aircraft. These cash outflows were offset in part by $960 million in net sales of short-term investments, $850 million of proceeds from aircraft sale-leaseback transactions and $250 million in proceeds from a vendor.American’s principal investing activities in 2018 included expenditures of $3.7 billion for property and equipment, including 16 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, six Boeing 787 family aircraft and five Embraer E175 aircraft. These cash outflows were offset in part by $1.1 billion of proceeds from aircraft sale-leaseback transactions and $293 million in net sales of short-term investments.Financing ActivitiesAmerican’s net cash used in financing activities was $282 million and $147 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.61American’s principal financing activities in 2019 included $3.4 billion in debt repayments, consisting of $2.1 billion in scheduled debt repayments and the prepayment of $1.3 billion of secured loans. These cash outflows were offset in part by $3.2 billion in proceeds from the issuance of debt for equipment notes related to EETCs and the financing of certain aircraft and other flight equipment.American’s principal financing activities in 2018 included $2.4 billion in debt repayments, consisting of $1.9 billion in scheduled debt repayments and the prepayment of $513 million of secured loans. These cash outflows were offset by $2.4 billion in proceeds from the issuance of debt, consisting of $1.9 billion in connection with the issuance of equipment notes related to EETCs and the financing of certain aircraft and pre-delivery purchase deposits, as well as an incremental $500 million on a term loan facility.CommitmentsFor further information regarding our commitments, see the Notes to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and the Notes to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B at the referenced footnotes below.\\xa0AAG\\xa0\\xa0AmericanLong-term debt and debt covenantsNote\\xa05\\xa0\\xa0Note\\xa03LeasesNote 6\\xa0Note 4Employee benefit plansNote 10\\xa0\\xa0Note 8Commitments, contingencies and guaranteesNote\\xa012\\xa0\\xa0Note 10Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAn off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1)\\xa0made guarantees, (2)\\xa0a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3)\\xa0an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or (4)\\xa0any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with us.We have no off-balance sheet arrangements of the types described in the first three categories above that we believe may have a material current or future effect on financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Pass-Through TrustsAmerican currently operates 382 owned aircraft and 69 leased aircraft, and owns 79 spare aircraft engines, which in each case were financed with EETCs issued by pass-through trusts. These trusts are off-balance sheet entities, the primary purpose of which is to finance the acquisition of flight equipment or to permit issuance of debt backed by existing flight equipment. In the case of aircraft EETCs, rather than finance each aircraft separately when such aircraft is purchased, delivered or refinanced, these trusts allow American to raise the financing for a number of aircraft at one time and, if applicable, place such funds in escrow pending a future purchase, delivery or refinancing of the relevant aircraft. Similarly, in the case of the spare engine EETCs, the trusts allow American to use its existing pool of spare engines to raise financing under a single facility. The trusts have also been structured to provide for certain credit enhancements, such as liquidity facilities to cover certain interest payments, that reduce the risks to the purchasers of the trust certificates and, as a result, reduce the cost of aircraft financing to American.Each trust covers a set number of aircraft or spare engines scheduled to be delivered, financed or refinanced upon the issuance of the EETC or within a specific period of time thereafter. At the time of each covered aircraft or spare engine financing, the relevant trust used the proceeds of the issuance of the EETC (which may have been available at the time of issuance thereof or held in escrow until financing of the applicable aircraft following its delivery) to purchase equipment notes relating to the financed aircraft or engines. The equipment notes are issued, at American’s election, in connection with a mortgage financing of the aircraft or spare engines or, in certain cases, by a separate owner trust in connection with a leveraged lease financing of the aircraft. In the case of a leveraged lease financing, the owner trust then leases the aircraft to American. In both cases, the equipment notes are secured by a security interest in the aircraft or engines, as applicable. The pass-through trust certificates are not direct obligations of, nor are they guaranteed by, AAG or American. However, in the case of mortgage financings, the equipment notes issued to the trusts are direct obligations of American and, in certain instances, have been guaranteed by AAG. As of December\\xa031, 2019, $11.9 billion associated with these mortgage financings is reflected as debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.62With respect to leveraged leases, American evaluated whether the leases had characteristics of a variable interest entity. American concluded the leasing entities met the criteria for variable interest entities; however, American concluded it is not the primary beneficiary under these leasing arrangements and accounts for the majority of its EETC leveraged lease financings as operating leases. American’s total future payments to the trusts of each of the relevant EETCs under these leveraged lease financings are $177 million as of December\\xa031, 2019. Letters of Credit and OtherWe provide financial assurance, such as letters of credit, surety bonds or restricted cash and investments, primarily to support projected workers’ compensation obligations and airport commitments. As of December\\xa031, 2019, we had $572 million of letters of credit and surety bonds securing various obligations. The letters of credit and surety bonds that are subject to expiration will expire on various dates through 2022.Contractual ObligationsThe following table provides details of our future cash contractual obligations as of December\\xa031, 2019.

(e)\\xa0See Part I, Item 2. Properties – “Aircraft and Engine Purchase Commitments” for additional information about the firm commitment aircraft delivery schedule, in particular the footnotes to the table thereunder as to potential changes to such delivery schedule. Due to uncertainty surrounding the timing of delivery of certain aircraft, the amounts in the table represent our current best estimate, including with respect to the delivery of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft; however, the actual delivery schedule may differ from the table above, potentially materially. Additionally, the amounts in the table exclude 22 787-8 aircraft to be delivered in 2020 and 2021 for which Boeing has committed to provide sale-leaseback financing (in the form of operating leases). This financing is reflected in the operating lease commitments line above. (f)\\xa0Represents minimum payments under capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers. These commitments are estimates of costs based on assumed minimum levels of flying under the capacity purchase agreements and our actual payments could differ materially. Rental payments under operating leases for certain aircraft flown under these capacity purchase agreements are reflected in the operating lease commitments line above.(g)\\xa0Includes minimum pension contributions based on actuarially determined estimates and is based on estimated payments through 2029.(h)\\xa0Includes purchase commitments for aircraft fuel, construction projects and information technology support.Capital Raising Activity and Other Possible ActionsIn light of our significant financial commitments related to, among other things, new flight equipment, the servicing and amortization of existing debt and equipment leasing arrangements, and future pension funding obligations, we and our subsidiaries will regularly consider, and enter into negotiations related to, capital raising activity, which may include the entry into leasing transactions and future issuances of secured or unsecured debt obligations or additional equity securities in public or private offerings or otherwise. The cash available from operations and these sources, however, may not be sufficient to cover cash contractual obligations because economic factors may reduce the amount of cash generated by operations or increase costs. For instance, an economic downturn or general global instability caused by military actions, terrorism, disease outbreaks, natural disasters or other causes could reduce the demand for air travel, which would reduce the amount of cash generated by operations. An increase in costs, either due to an increase in borrowing costs caused by a reduction in credit ratings or a general increase in interest rates, or due to an increase in the cost of fuel, maintenance, aircraft, aircraft engines or parts, could decrease the amount of cash available to cover cash contractual obligations. Moreover, certain of our financing arrangements contain significant minimum cash balance requirements. As a result, we cannot use all of our available cash to fund operations, capital expenditures and cash obligations without violating these requirements. See Note 5 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 3 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for information regarding our financing arrangements.In the past, we have from time to time refinanced, redeemed or repurchased our debt and taken other steps to reduce or otherwise manage the aggregate amount and cost of our debt or lease obligations or otherwise improve our balance sheet. Going forward, depending on market conditions, our cash position and other considerations, we may continue to take such actions.Our Board of Directors has from time to time authorized programs to repurchase shares of our common stock, one of which is currently in effect, and may authorize additional share repurchase programs in the future.OTHER INFORMATIONBasis of PresentationSee Note 1 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item\\xa08A and Note 1 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item\\xa08B for information regarding the basis of presentation.64Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from those estimates. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We have identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. See the “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” included in Note 1 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item\\xa08A and Note 1 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item\\xa08B for additional discussion of the application of these estimates and other accounting policies.Passenger RevenueWe recognize all revenues generated from transportation on American and our regional flights operated under the brand name American Eagle, including associated baggage fees, ticketing change fees and other inflight services, as passenger revenue when transportation is provided. Ticket and other related sales for transportation that has not yet been provided are initially deferred and recorded as air traffic liability on our consolidated balance sheets. The air traffic liability principally represents tickets sold for future travel on American and partner airlines, as well as estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel. The majority of tickets sold are nonrefundable. A small percentage of tickets, some of which are partially used tickets, expire unused. Due to complex pricing structures, refund and exchange policies, and interline agreements with other airlines, certain amounts are recognized in passenger revenue using estimates regarding both the timing of the revenue recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized. These estimates are generally based on the analysis of our historical data. We have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from unused tickets at the date of travel. Estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic liability are routinely evaluated based on subsequent activity to validate the accuracy of our estimates. Any adjustments resulting from periodic evaluations of the estimated air traffic liability are included in passenger revenue during the period in which the evaluations are completed. Various taxes and fees assessed on the sale of tickets to end customers are collected by us as an agent and remitted to taxing authorities. These taxes and fees have been presented on a net basis in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and recorded as a liability until remitted to the appropriate taxing authority.Loyalty RevenueWe currently operate the loyalty program, AAdvantage. This program awards mileage credits to passengers who fly on American, any oneworld airline or other partner airlines, or by using the services of other program participants, such as the Citi and Barclaycard US co-branded credit cards, and certain hotels and car rental companies. Mileage credits can be redeemed for travel on American and other participating partner airlines, as well as other non-air travel awards such as hotels and rental cars. For mileage credits earned by AAdvantage loyalty program members, we apply the deferred revenue method.Mileage credits earned through travelFor mileage credits earned through travel, we apply a relative selling price approach whereby the total amount collected from each passenger ticket sale is allocated between the air transportation and the mileage credits earned. The portion of each passenger ticket sale attributable to mileage credits earned is initially deferred and then recognized in passenger revenue when mileage credits are redeemed and transportation is provided. The estimated selling price of mileage credits is determined using an equivalent ticket value approach, which uses historical data, including award redemption patterns by geographic region and class of service, as well as similar fares as those used to settle award redemptions. The estimated selling price of miles is adjusted for an estimate of miles that will not be redeemed based on historical redemption patterns.  For the year ended December\\xa031, 2019, a hypothetical 10% increase in the estimated selling price of miles would have decreased revenues by approximately $135 million as a result of additional amounts deferred from passenger ticket sales to be recognized in future periods. 65Mileage credits sold to co-branded credit cards and other partners We sell mileage credits to participating airline partners and non-airline business partners, including our co-branded credit card partners, under contracts with terms extending generally for one to seven years. Consideration received from the sale of mileage credits is variable and payment terms typically are within 30 days subsequent to the month of mileage sale. Sales of mileage credits to non-airline business partners are comprised of two components, transportation and marketing. We allocate the consideration received from these sales of mileage credits based on the relative selling price of each product or service delivered.Our most significant partner agreements are our co-branded credit card agreements with Citi and Barclaycard US that we entered into in 2016. We identified the following revenue elements in these co-branded credit card agreements: the transportation component; and the use of intellectual property, including the American brand and access to loyalty program member lists, which is the predominant element in the agreements, as well as advertising (collectively, the marketing component). Accordingly, we recognize the marketing component in other revenue in the period of the mileage sale following the sales-based royalty method.The transportation component represents the estimated selling price of future travel awards and is determined using the same equivalent ticket value approach described above. The portion of each mileage credit sold attributable to transportation is initially deferred and then recognized in passenger revenue when mileage credits are redeemed and transportation is provided.For the portion of our outstanding mileage credits that we estimate will not be redeemed, we recognize the associated value proportionally as the remaining mileage credits are redeemed. Our estimates are based on analysis of historical redemptions. For the year ended December\\xa031, 2019, a hypothetical 10% increase in our estimate of miles not expected to be redeemed would have increased revenues by approximately $95 million.Cargo RevenueCargo revenue is recognized when we provide the transportation.Other RevenueOther revenue includes revenue associated with our loyalty program, which is comprised principally of the marketing component of mileage sales to co-branded credit card and other partners and other marketing related payments. The accounting and recognition for the loyalty program marketing services are discussed above in “Loyalty Revenue.” The remaining amounts included within other revenue relate to airport clubs, advertising and vacation-related services.Long-lived AssetsLong-lived assets consist of flight equipment, as well as other fixed assets and definite-lived intangible assets such as certain domestic airport slots, customer relationships, marketing agreements, tradenames and airport gate leasehold rights. In addition to the original cost, the recorded value of our fixed assets is impacted by a number of estimates made, including estimated useful lives, salvage values and our determination as to whether aircraft are temporarily or permanently grounded. Definite-lived intangible assets are originally recorded at their acquired fair values and are subsequently amortized over their estimated useful lives. See Note 1 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item\\xa08A and Note 1 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item\\xa08B for further information.We assess impairment of long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. An asset or group of assets is considered impaired when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets and the net book value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair value. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Estimates of fair value represent management’s best estimate based on appraisals, industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions.The majority of American’s aircraft fleet types are depreciated over 25-30 years. It is possible that the ultimate lives of our aircraft will be significantly different than the current estimate due to unforeseen events in the future that impact our fleet plan. 66Goodwill and Indefinite-lived AssetsGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but is assessed for impairment annually on October\\xa01 or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. We have one consolidated reporting unit.Indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill include certain domestic airport slots and international slots and route authorities. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but instead are assessed for impairment annually on October\\xa01 or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment by initially performing a qualitative assessment. Under the qualitative approach, we analyze the following factors, among others, to determine if events and circumstances have affected the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets: (1)\\xa0negative trends in our market capitalization, (2)\\xa0an increase in fuel prices, (3)\\xa0declining per mile passenger yields, (4)\\xa0lower passenger demand as a result of a weakened U.S. and global economy and (5)\\xa0changes to the regulatory environment.Based upon our annual assessment, there were no impairments of our goodwill and no material impairments of our indefinite-lived assets in 2019.Pensions and Retiree Medical and Other Postretirement BenefitsWe recognize the funded status (i.e., the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations) of our pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans in the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).Our pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits costs and liabilities are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies. We use certain assumptions including, but not limited to, the selection of the: (1)\\xa0discount rate, (2)\\xa0expected return on plan assets and (3)\\xa0expected health care cost trend rate (as discussed below). These assumptions as of December\\xa031 were:\\xa02019\\xa02018Pension weighted average discount rate (1)3.4%\\xa04.4%Retiree medical and other postretirement benefits weighted average discount rate\\xa0(1)3.3%\\xa04.3%Expected rate of return on plan assets (2)8.0%\\xa08.0%Weighted average health care cost trend rate assumed for next year (3):\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Initial3.7%\\xa03.9%Ultimate (2027)3.3%\\xa03.5%\\xa0\\xa0(1)\\xa0When establishing our discount rate to measure our obligations, we match high quality corporate bonds available in the marketplace whose cash flows approximate our projected benefit disbursements. Lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points as of December\\xa031, 2019 would increase our pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits obligations by approximately $1.3 billion and $40 million, respectively, decrease estimated 2020 pension expense by approximately $5 million and increase estimated 2020 retiree medical and other postretirement benefits expense by less than $1 million.(2)\\xa0The expected rate of return on plan assets is based upon an evaluation of our historical trends and experience, taking into account current and expected market conditions and our target asset allocation of 26% U.S. stocks, 16% developed international stocks, 30% fixed income securities, 20% alternative (private) investments and 8% emerging market stocks. The expected rate of return on plan assets component of our net periodic benefit cost is calculated based on the fair value of plan assets and our target asset allocation. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by 50 basis points as of December\\xa031, 2019 would increase estimated 2020 pension expense and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits expense by approximately $65 million and $1 million, respectively.(3)\\xa0The assumed health care cost trend rate is based upon an evaluation of our historical trends and experience, taking into account current and expected market conditions. Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by 100 basis points would increase estimated 2020 retiree medical and other postretirement benefits expense by approximately $5 million.67During 2019, we reviewed and revised certain economic and demographic assumptions including the pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits discount rates and health care cost trend rates. The net effect of changing these assumptions for the pension plans resulted in an increase of $2.1 billion in the projected benefit obligation at December\\xa031, 2019. The net effect of changing these assumptions for retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans resulted in an increase of $71 million in the projected benefit obligation at December\\xa031, 2019. We also revised our mortality assumptions to incorporate the new Pri-2012 mortality tables and improvement scale issued by the Society of Actuaries. This resulted in a decrease in the projected benefit obligations of our pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans of $127 million and $11 million, respectively.See Note 10 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item\\xa08A and Note 8 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item\\xa08B for additional information regarding our employee benefit plans.Recent Accounting PronouncementASU 2016-13: Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326)This ASU requires the use of an expected loss model for certain types of financial instruments and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to calculate credit loss estimates. For trade receivables, loans and held-to-maturity debt securities, an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses is required. For available-for-sale debt securities, an allowance for credit losses will be required rather than a reduction to the carrying value of the asset. This standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. While we have not completed our evaluation of the impact of adoption of this standard, we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.ITEM\\xa07A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKThe risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the price of fuel, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as discussed below. The sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity, nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes. Therefore, actual results may differ. See Note 8 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item\\xa08A and Note 6 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional discussion regarding risk management matters.Aircraft FuelOur operating results are materially impacted by changes in the availability, price volatility and cost of aircraft fuel, which represents one of the largest single cost items in our business. Because of the amount of fuel needed to operate our business, even a relatively small increase or decrease in the price of fuel can have a material effect on our costs and liquidity. Market prices for aircraft fuel can be volatile, with market spot prices ranging from a low of approximately $1.24 per gallon to a high of approximately $2.35 per gallon during the period from January\\xa01, 2017 to December\\xa031, 2019.As of December\\xa031, 2019, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding to hedge our fuel consumption. Our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, although we review that policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors. As such, and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices. Based on our 2020 forecasted fuel consumption, we estimate that a one cent per gallon increase in the price of aircraft fuel would increase our 2020 annual fuel expense by $47 million.Foreign CurrencyWe are exposed to the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency-denominated transactions. Our largest exposure comes from the British pound, Euro, Canadian dollar and various Latin American currencies, primarily the Brazilian real. We do not currently have a foreign currency hedge program. We estimate a uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar from 2019 levels relative to each of the currencies in which we have foreign currency exposure would have resulted in a decrease in pre-tax income of approximately $190 million for the year ended December\\xa031, 2019.68Generally, fluctuations in foreign currencies, including devaluations, cannot be predicted by us and can significantly affect the value of our assets located outside the United States. These conditions, as well as any further delays, devaluations or imposition of more stringent repatriation restrictions, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\\xa0– “We operate a global business with international operations that are subject to economic and political instability and have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by numerous events, circumstances or government actions beyond our control” for additional discussion of this and other currency risks.InterestOur earnings and cash flow are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our interest expense from variable-rate debt instruments and our interest income from short-term, interest bearing investments.Our largest exposure with respect to variable-rate debt comes from changes in LIBOR. We had variable-rate debt instruments representing approximately 40% of our total long-term debt at December\\xa031, 2019. We currently do not have an interest rate hedge program to hedge our exposure to floating interest rates on our variable-rate debt obligations. If annual interest rates increase 100 basis points, based on our December\\xa031, 2019 variable-rate debt and short-term investments balances, annual interest expense on variable-rate debt would increase by approximately $95 million and annual interest income on short-term investments would increase by approximately $40 million. Additionally, the fair value of fixed-rate debt would have decreased by approximately $600 million for AAG and $580 million for American.On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. Similarly, it is not possible to predict whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR, or what effect these changes in views or alternatives may have on financial markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments. While the U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index, calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities, we cannot currently predict whether this index will gain widespread acceptance as a replacement for LIBOR. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere.We may in the future pursue amendments to our LIBOR-based debt transactions to provide for a transaction mechanism or other reference rate in anticipation of LIBOR’s discontinuation, but we may not be able to reach agreement with our lenders on any such amendments. As of December\\xa031, 2019, we had $9.6 billion of borrowings based on LIBOR. The replacement of LIBOR with a comparable or successor rate could cause the amount of interest payable on our long-term debt to be different or higher than expected.69ITEM\\xa08A.\\xa0CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Stockholders and Board of DirectorsAmerican Airlines Group Inc.:Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American Airlines Group Inc. and\\xa0subsidiaries (the Company) as of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders’ equity (deficit) for each of the years in the three-year period ended December\\xa031, 2019, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December\\xa031, 2019, in conformity with U.S.\\xa0generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December\\xa031, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February\\xa019, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases as of January 1, 2018 due to the modified retrospective adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), as amended.Basis for OpinionThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.\\xa0federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.70Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Evaluation of estimated passenger travel revenueAs discussed in Note 1(k) to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded passenger travel revenue of $38.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Passenger travel revenue includes an estimate for the amount of revenue recognized for tickets that will expire unused in whole or in part. The percentage of passenger tickets that are expected to expire unused is estimated based on an analysis of the Company’s historical data.We identified the evaluation of estimated passenger travel revenue as a critical audit matter. A high degree of auditor judgment was required to assess the underlying assumption made by the Company to develop this estimate. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company’s passenger revenue recognition process, including controls related to the estimation of the percentage of passenger tickets that are expected to expire unused. We assessed the Company’s estimate of the percentage of passenger tickets expected to expire unused by comparing previous years’ estimates to the actual percentage of passenger tickets expired unused for the year. We evaluated the estimated amount of revenue recorded in the current year related to passenger tickets that are expected to expire unused by developing an independent expectation using actual historical ticket expirations. We compared our independent expectation to that of the Company. Assessment of the estimated selling price for mileage credits earned through travelAs discussed in Note 1(k) to the consolidated financial statements, the Company applies a relative selling price approach whereby the total amount collected from each applicable passenger ticket sale is allocated between the air transportation and the mileage credits earned. The mileage credits earned are deferred and recognized in passenger revenue at the time mileage credits are redeemed and transportation is provided. The Company estimates the selling price of mileage credits earned through travel using an approach based on inputs and assumptions derived from historical data. Additionally, an adjustment is made to the estimated selling price of mileage credits earned to account for the estimate of mileage credits not expected to be redeemed. The Company’s loyalty program liability was $8.6 billion as of December 31, 2019, and the associated passenger revenue for mileage credits redeemed for travel was $3.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019.  We identified the assessment of the estimated selling price for mileage credits earned through travel, including the estimated number of mileage credits not expected to be redeemed, as a critical audit matter. A high degree of auditor judgment was required to evaluate the historical data used to develop the estimate. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company’s loyalty program accounting process, including controls related to the estimation of the selling price for mileage credits earned through travel. We evaluated that the Company’s methodology used to develop the estimated selling price of mileage credits earned through travel, including estimated mileage credits not expected to be redeemed, was consistent with that of historical periods. We performed sensitivity analyses over the estimated selling price of mileage credits earned through travel, including estimated mileage credits not expected to be redeemed. We assessed the results of the sensitivity analyses to the Company’s recorded amount of loyalty program liability and the associated passenger revenue.  We compared the Company’s estimate of mileage credits not expected to be redeemed to that of other airlines within the industry. /s/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0KPMG LLPWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2014.

INC.1.\\xa0\\xa0Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies(a) Basis of PresentationAmerican Airlines Group Inc. (we, us, our and similar terms, or AAG), a Delaware corporation, is a holding company whose primary business activity is the operation of a major network air carrier, providing scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo through its mainline operating subsidiary, American Airlines, Inc. (American) and its wholly-owned regional airline subsidiaries, Envoy Aviation Group Inc., PSA Airlines, Inc. and Piedmont Airlines, Inc. that operate under the brand American Eagle. On December 9, 2013, a subsidiary of AMR Corporation (AMR) merged with and into US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways Group), a Delaware corporation, which survived as a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAG, and AAG emerged from Chapter 11 (the Merger). Upon closing of the Merger and emergence from Chapter 11, AMR changed its name to American Airlines Group Inc. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The most significant areas of judgment relate to passenger revenue recognition, impairment of goodwill, impairment of long-lived and intangible assets, the loyalty program, as well as pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits.(b) Recent Accounting PronouncementsASU 2016-02: Leases (Topic 842) (the New Lease Standard)The New Lease Standard requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use (ROU) asset on the balance sheet for operating leases. Accounting for finance leases is substantially unchanged. The New Lease Standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December\\xa015, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.In the fourth quarter of 2018, we elected to early adopt the New Lease Standard as of January 1, 2018 using a modified retrospective transition, with the cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the effective date (the effective date method). Under the effective date method, financial results reported in periods prior to 2018 are unchanged. We also elected the package of practical expedients, which among other things, does not require reassessment of lease classification.The adoption of the New Lease Standard had a significant impact on our consolidated balance sheet due to the recognition of approximately $10 billion of lease liabilities with corresponding right-of-use assets for operating leases.Additionally, we recognized a $197 million cumulative effect adjustment credit, net of tax, to retained earnings. The adjustment to retained earnings was driven principally by sale-leaseback transactions including the recognition of unamortized deferred aircraft sale-leaseback gains. Prior to the adoption of the New Lease Standard, gains on sale-leaseback transactions were generally deferred and recognized in the income statement over the lease term. Under the New Lease Standard, gains on sale-leaseback transactions (subject to adjustment for off-market terms) are recognized immediately.ASU 2018-02: Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive IncomeThis ASU provides the option to reclassify stranded tax effects within accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings due to the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate change as a result of H.R. 1, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Act). The amount of the reclassification is the difference between the amount initially charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income at the previous U.S. federal corporate income tax rate that remains in accumulated other comprehensive income and the amount that would have been charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income using the newly enacted U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, excluding the effect of any valuation allowance previously charged to income from continuing operations. This standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. In the first quarter of 2019, we adopted this standard retrospectively as of December 22, 2017, the date the 2017 Tax Act was enacted, which resulted in the recast of prior reporting periods. As a result of the adoption, we reclassified $622 million of stranded tax effects principally related to our pension plans from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings. 77NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.ASU 2016-13: Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326)This ASU requires the use of an expected loss model for certain types of financial instruments and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to calculate credit loss estimates. For trade receivables, loans and held-to-maturity debt securities, an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses is required. For available-for-sale debt securities, an allowance for credit losses will be required rather than a reduction to the carrying value of the asset. This standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. While we have not completed our evaluation of the impact of adoption of this standard, we do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.(c) Short-term InvestmentsShort-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and stated at fair value. Realized gains and losses are recorded in nonoperating expense on our consolidated statements of operations. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheets.(d) Restricted Cash and Short-term InvestmentsWe have restricted cash and short-term investments related primarily to collateral held to support workers’ compensation obligations.(e) Aircraft Fuel, Spare Parts and Supplies, NetAircraft fuel is recorded on a first-in, first-out basis. Spare parts and supplies are recorded at average costs less an allowance for obsolescence. These items are expensed when used.(f) Operating Property and EquipmentOperating property and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated or amortized to residual values over the asset’s estimated useful life or the lease term, whichever is less, using the straight-line method. Residual values for aircraft, engines and related rotable parts are generally 5% to 10% of original cost. Costs of major improvements that enhance the usefulness of the asset are capitalized and depreciated or amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term, whichever is less. The estimated useful lives for the principal property and equipment classifications are as follows:Principal Property and Equipment ClassificationEstimated Useful LifeAircraft, engines and related rotable parts20\\xa0–\\xa030 yearsBuildings and improvements5\\xa0–\\xa030\\xa0yearsFurniture, fixtures and other equipment3\\xa0–\\xa010 yearsCapitalized software5\\xa0–\\xa010 yearsWe assess impairment of operating property and equipment when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. An asset or group of assets is considered impaired when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets and the net book value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair value. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell.Total depreciation and amortization expense was $2.6 billion, $2.4 billion and $2.2 billion for the years ended December\\xa031, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.(g) LeasesWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets, current operating lease liabilities and noncurrent operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, current maturities of long-term debt and finance leases and long-term debt and finance leases, net of current maturities, in our consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of lease payments over the lease term. 78NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.We use our estimated incremental borrowing rate, which is derived from information available at the lease commencement date, in determining the present value of lease payments. We give consideration to our recent debt issuances as well as publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics when calculating our incremental borrowing rates.Our lease term includes options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Our lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees.Under certain of our capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers, we do not own the underlying aircraft. However, since we control the marketing, scheduling, ticketing, pricing and seat inventories of these aircraft and therefore control the asset, the aircraft is deemed to be leased for accounting purposes. For these capacity purchase agreements, we account for the lease and non-lease components separately. The lease component consists of the aircraft and the non-lease components consist of services, such as the crew and maintenance. We allocate the consideration in the capacity purchase agreements to the lease and non-lease components using their estimated relative standalone prices. See Note 12(b) for additional information on our capacity purchase agreements.For real estate, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.(h) Income TaxesIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded net as noncurrent deferred income taxes.We provide a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of our deferred tax assets, will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income. We consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions in evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets. Many factors are considered that impact our assessment of future profitability, including conditions which are beyond our control, such as the health of the economy, the availability and price volatility of aircraft fuel and travel demand.(i) GoodwillGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually on October 1 or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. We have one consolidated reporting unit.Goodwill is assessed for impairment by initially performing a qualitative assessment and, if necessary, then comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is lower than its carrying value, an impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded. Based upon our annual assessment, there was no goodwill impairment in 2019. The carrying value of the goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets was $4.1 billion as of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018.(j) Other Intangibles, NetIntangible assets consist primarily of domestic airport slots, customer relationships, marketing agreements, international slots and route authorities, airport gate leasehold rights and tradenames.Definite-Lived Intangible AssetsDefinite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.79NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.The following table provides information relating to our amortizable intangible assets as of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018 (in millions):\\xa0December\\xa031,\\xa02019\\xa02018Domestic airport slots$365\\xa0$365Customer relationships300\\xa0300Marketing agreements105\\xa0105Tradenames35\\xa035Airport gate leasehold rights137\\xa0137Accumulated amortization(704)\\xa0(663)Total$238\\xa0$279Certain domestic airport slots and airport gate leasehold rights are amortized on a straight-line basis over 25 years. The customer relationships and marketing agreements were identified as intangible assets subject to amortization and are amortized on a straight-line basis over approximately nine years and 30 years, respectively. Tradenames are fully amortized.We recorded amortization expense related to these intangible assets of $41 million for both years ended December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018 and $44 million for 2017. We expect to record annual amortization expense for these intangible assets as follows (in millions):2020$4120214120224120237202472025 and thereafter101Total$238Indefinite-Lived Intangible AssetsIndefinite-lived intangible assets include certain domestic airport slots and international slots and route authorities. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but instead are assessed for impairment annually on October 1 or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. As of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, we had $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of indefinite-lived intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets.Indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment by initially performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether we believe it is more likely than not that an asset has been impaired. If we believe impairment has occurred, we then evaluate for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of assets to the carrying value. An impairment charge is recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value is less than its carrying value. Based upon our annual assessment, there were no material indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments in 2019.80NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.(k) Revenue RecognitionRevenueThe following are the significant categories comprising our reported operating revenues (in millions):\\xa0Year Ended December 31,\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017Passenger revenue:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Passenger travel$38,831\\xa0$37,457\\xa0$36,152Loyalty revenue - travel (1)3,179\\xa03,219\\xa02,979Total passenger revenue42,010\\xa040,676\\xa039,131Cargo863\\xa01,013\\xa0890Other:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Loyalty revenue - marketing services2,361\\xa02,352\\xa02,124Other revenue534\\xa0500\\xa0477Total other revenue2,895\\xa02,852\\xa02,601Total operating revenues$45,768\\xa0$44,541\\xa0$42,622\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(1)\\xa0Loyalty revenue included in passenger revenue is principally comprised of mileage credit redemptions earned through travel or from co-branded credit card and other partners. See “Loyalty Revenue” below for further discussion on these mileage credits.The following is our total passenger revenue by geographic region (in millions):\\xa0Year Ended December 31,\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017Domestic$30,881\\xa0$29,573\\xa0$28,749Latin America5,047\\xa05,125\\xa04,840Atlantic4,624\\xa04,376\\xa04,028Pacific1,458\\xa01,602\\xa01,514Total passenger revenue$42,010\\xa0$40,676\\xa0$39,131We attribute passenger revenue by geographic region based upon the origin and destination of each flight segment.Passenger RevenueWe recognize all revenues generated from transportation on American and our regional flights operated under the brand name American Eagle, including associated baggage fees, ticketing change fees and other inflight services, as passenger revenue when transportation is provided. Ticket and other related sales for transportation that has not yet been provided are initially deferred and recorded as air traffic liability on our consolidated balance sheets. The air traffic liability principally represents tickets sold for future travel on American and partner airlines, as well as estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel. The majority of tickets sold are nonrefundable. A small percentage of tickets, some of which are partially used tickets, expire unused. Due to complex pricing structures, refund and exchange policies, and interline agreements with other airlines, certain amounts are recognized in passenger revenue using estimates regarding both the timing of the revenue recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized. These estimates are generally based on the analysis of our historical data. We have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from unused tickets at the date of travel. Estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic liability are routinely evaluated based on subsequent activity to validate the accuracy of our estimates. Any adjustments resulting from periodic evaluations of the estimated air traffic liability are included in passenger revenue during the period in which the evaluations are completed. 81NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.Various taxes and fees assessed on the sale of tickets to end customers are collected by us as an agent and remitted to taxing authorities. These taxes and fees have been presented on a net basis in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and recorded as a liability until remitted to the appropriate taxing authority.Loyalty RevenueWe currently operate the loyalty program, AAdvantage. This program awards mileage credits to passengers who fly on American, any oneworld airline or other partner airlines, or by using the services of other program participants, such as the Citi and Barclaycard US co-branded credit cards, and certain hotels and car rental companies. Mileage credits can be redeemed for travel on American and other participating partner airlines, as well as other non-air travel awards such as hotels and rental cars. For mileage credits earned by AAdvantage loyalty program members, we apply the deferred revenue method.Mileage credits earned through travelFor mileage credits earned through travel, we apply a relative selling price approach whereby the total amount collected from each passenger ticket sale is allocated between the air transportation and the mileage credits earned. The portion of each passenger ticket sale attributable to mileage credits earned is initially deferred and then recognized in passenger revenue when mileage credits are redeemed and transportation is provided. The estimated selling price of mileage credits is determined using an equivalent ticket value approach, which uses historical data, including award redemption patterns by geographic region and class of service, as well as similar fares as those used to settle award redemptions. The estimated selling price of miles is adjusted for an estimate of miles that will not be redeemed based on historical redemption patterns. Mileage credits sold to co-branded credit cards and other partners We sell mileage credits to participating airline partners and non-airline business partners, including our co-branded credit card partners, under contracts with terms extending generally for one to seven years. Consideration received from the sale of mileage credits is variable and payment terms typically are within 30 days subsequent to the month of mileage sale. Sales of mileage credits to non-airline business partners are comprised of two components, transportation and marketing. We allocate the consideration received from these sales of mileage credits based on the relative selling price of each product or service delivered.Our most significant partner agreements are our co-branded credit card agreements with Citi and Barclaycard US that we entered into in 2016. We identified the following revenue elements in these co-branded credit card agreements: the transportation component; and the use of intellectual property, including the American brand and access to loyalty program member lists, which is the predominant element in the agreements, as well as advertising (collectively, the marketing component). Accordingly, we recognize the marketing component in other revenue in the period of the mileage sale following the sales-based royalty method.The transportation component represents the estimated selling price of future travel awards and is determined using the same equivalent ticket value approach described above. The portion of each mileage credit sold attributable to transportation is initially deferred and then recognized in passenger revenue when mileage credits are redeemed and transportation is provided.For the portion of our outstanding mileage credits that we estimate will not be redeemed, we recognize the associated value proportionally as the remaining mileage credits are redeemed. Our estimates are based on analysis of historical redemptions.Cargo RevenueCargo revenue is recognized when we provide the transportation.Other RevenueOther revenue includes revenue associated with our loyalty program, which is comprised principally of the marketing component of mileage sales to co-branded credit card and other partners and other marketing related payments. Loyalty revenue included in other revenue was $2.4 billion for both years ended December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018 and $2.1 billion for 2017. The accounting and recognition for the loyalty program marketing services are discussed above in “Loyalty Revenue.” The remaining amounts included within other revenue relate to airport clubs, advertising and vacation-related services.82NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.Contract BalancesOur significant contract liabilities are comprised of (1) outstanding loyalty program mileage credits that may be redeemed for future travel and other non-air travel awards, reported as loyalty program liability on our consolidated balance sheets and (2) ticket sales for transportation that has not yet been provided, reported as air traffic liability on our consolidated balance sheets.\\xa0December 31,\\xa020192018\\xa0(in millions)Loyalty program liability$8,615\\xa0$8,539Air traffic liability4,808\\xa04,339Total$13,423\\xa0$12,878The balance of the loyalty program liability fluctuates based on seasonal patterns, which impact the volume of mileage credits issued through travel or sold to co-branded credit card and other partners (deferral of revenue) and mileage credits redeemed (recognition of revenue).

Mileage credits are combined in one homogenous pool and are not separately identifiable. As such, the revenue is comprised of miles that were part of the loyalty program deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period, as well as miles that were issued during the period.(2)\\xa0Mileage credits can be redeemed at any time and do not expire as long as that AAdvantage member has any type of qualifying activity at least every 18 months. As of December\\xa031, 2019, our current loyalty program liability was $3.2 billion and represents our current estimate of revenue expected to be recognized in the next 12 months based on historical trends, with the balance reflected in long-term loyalty program liability expected to be recognized as revenue in periods thereafter.The air traffic liability principally represents tickets sold for future travel on American and partner airlines, as well as estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel. The balance in our air traffic liability also fluctuates with seasonal travel patterns. The contract duration of passenger tickets is one year. Accordingly, any revenue associated with tickets sold for future travel will be recognized within 12 months. For 2019, $3.3 billion of revenue was recognized in passenger revenue that was included in our air traffic liability at December\\xa031, 2018.With respect to contract receivables, reflected as accounts receivable, net on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, these primarily include receivables for tickets sold to individual passengers through the use of major credit cards. These receivables are short-term, mostly settled within seven days after sale. Bad debt losses, which have been minimal in the past, have been considered in establishing allowances for doubtful accounts.(l) Maintenance, Materials and RepairsMaintenance and repair costs for owned and leased flight equipment are charged to operating expense as incurred, except costs incurred for maintenance and repair under flight hour maintenance contract agreements, which are accrued based on contractual terms when an obligation exists.(m) Selling ExpensesSelling expenses include credit card fees, commissions, computerized reservations systems fees and advertising. Selling expenses associated with passenger revenue are expensed when the transportation or service is provided. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $129 million, $128 million and $135 million for the years ended December\\xa031, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.83NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.(n) Share-based CompensationWe account for our share-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the stock award at the time of grant, which is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the stock award. The majority of our stock awards are time vested restricted stock units, and the fair value of such awards is based on the market price of the underlying shares of AAG common stock on the date of grant. See Note 15 for further discussion of share-based compensation.(o) Foreign Currency Gains and LossesForeign currency gains and losses are recorded as part of other income, net within total nonoperating expense, net in our consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December\\xa031, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, foreign currency losses were $32 million, $55 million and $4 million.(p) Other Operating ExpensesOther operating expenses includes costs associated with ground and cargo handling, crew travel, aircraft food and catering, passenger accommodation, airport security, international navigation fees and certain general and administrative expenses.(q) Regional ExpensesExpenses associated with American Eagle operations are classified as regional expenses on our consolidated statements of operations.

Since July 2014, our Board of Directors has approved seven share repurchase programs aggregating $13.0 billion of authority. As of December\\xa031, 2019, there was $565 million of remaining authority to repurchase shares under our current $2.0 billion share repurchase program. Share repurchases under our repurchase programs may be made through a variety of methods, which may include open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions. Any such repurchases that may be made from time to time will be subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares and our repurchase of AAG common stock may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion and without prior notice. In 2019, we repurchased 33.8 million shares of AAG common stock for $1.1 billion at a weighted average cost per share of $32.09. In 2018, we repurchased 16.6 million shares of AAG common stock for $800 million at a weighted average cost per share of $48.15. In 2017, we repurchased 33.9 million shares of AAG common stock for $1.6 billion at a weighted average cost per share of $45.68. Since the inception of our share repurchase programs in July 2014 through December 31, 2019, we have repurchased 312.7 million shares of AAG common stock for $12.4 billion at a weighted average cost per share of $39.76.Our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per share totaling $178 million, $186 million and $198 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.86NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.5.\\xa0\\xa0DebtLong-term debt included on our consolidated balance sheets consisted of (in\\xa0millions):\\xa0December\\xa031,\\xa02019\\xa02018Secured\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02013 Credit Facilities, variable interest rate of 3.54%, installments through 2025 (a)$1,807\\xa0$1,8252014 Credit Facilities, variable interest rate of 3.72%, installments through 2021 (a)1,202\\xa01,215April 2016 Credit Facilities, variable interest rate of 3.80%, installments through 2023 (a)970\\xa0980December 2016 Credit Facilities, variable interest rate of 3.74%, installments through 2023 (a)1,213\\xa01,225Enhanced equipment trust certificates (EETCs), fixed interest rates ranging from 3.00% to 8.39%, averaging 4.05%, maturing from 2020 to 2032 (b)11,933\\xa011,648Equipment loans and other notes payable, fixed and variable interest rates ranging from 2.99% to 7.31%, averaging 3.45%, maturing from 2020 to 2031 (c)4,727\\xa05,060Special facility revenue bonds, fixed interest rates ranging from 5.00% to 8.00%, maturing from 2020 to 2031754\\xa0798\\xa022,606\\xa022,751Unsecured\\xa0\\xa0\\xa04.625% senior notes, interest only payments until due in March 2020 (d)500\\xa05005.000% senior notes, interest only payments until due in June 2022 (d)750\\xa0—5.50% senior notes—\\xa0750\\xa01,250\\xa01,250Total long-term debt 23,856\\xa024,001Less: Total unamortized debt discount, premium and issuance costs211\\xa0222Less: Current maturities2,749\\xa03,213Long-term debt, net of current maturities$20,896\\xa0$20,566The table below shows the maximum availability under revolving credit facilities, all of which were undrawn, as of December\\xa031, 2019 (in millions):2013 Revolving Facility$7502014 Revolving Facility1,643April 2016 Revolving Facility450Other Short-term Revolving Facility400Total$3,243Secured financings are collateralized by assets, primarily aircraft, engines, simulators, aircraft spare parts, airport gate leasehold rights, route authorities, airport slots and certain pre-delivery payments.

In addition, certain lenders party to the April 2016 Credit Agreement extended the maturity date of their commitments under the April 2016 Revolving Facility to October\\xa02024 from October 2023.December 2016 Credit FacilitiesIn December 2016, American and AAG entered into the Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement, dated as of December 15, 2016 (as amended, the December 2016 Credit Agreement; the term loan facility established thereunder, the December 2016 Term Loan Facility; and together with the revolving credit facility that may be established thereunder in the future, the December 2016 Credit Facilities).Certain details of our 2013 Credit Facilities, 2014 Credit Facilities, April 2016 Credit Facilities and December 2016 Credit Facilities (collectively referred to as the Credit Facilities) are shown in the table below as of December\\xa031, 2019:\\xa02013 Credit Facilities\\xa02014 Credit Facilities\\xa0April 2016 Credit Facilities\\xa0December 2016 Credit Facilities\\xa02013 Replacement  Term Loan\\xa02013\\xa0Revolving Facility\\xa02014 Term Loan\\xa02014\\xa0RevolvingFacility\\xa0April 2016 Term Loan\\xa0April 2016\\xa0RevolvingFacility\\xa0December 2016 Term LoanAggregate principal issued\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0or credit facility availability\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(in millions)$1,919\\xa0$750\\xa0$1,250\\xa0$1,643\\xa0$1,000\\xa0$450\\xa0$1,250Principal outstanding or\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0drawn (in millions)$1,807\\xa0$—\\xa0$1,202\\xa0$—\\xa0$970\\xa0$—\\xa0$1,213Maturity dateJune 2025\\xa0October 2024\\xa0October 2021\\xa0October 2024\\xa0April 2023\\xa0October 2024\\xa0December 2023LIBOR margin1.75%\\xa02.00%\\xa02.00%\\xa02.00%\\xa02.00%\\xa02.00%\\xa02.00%The term loans under each of the Credit Facilities are repayable in annual installments in an amount equal to 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount issued, with any unpaid balance due on the respective maturity dates. Voluntary prepayments may be made by American at any time.88NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.The 2013 Revolving Facility, 2014 Revolving Facility and April 2016 Revolving Facility provide that American may from time to time borrow, repay and reborrow loans thereunder. The 2013 Revolving Facility and 2014 Revolving Facility have the ability to issue letters of credit thereunder in an aggregate amount outstanding at any time up to $100 million and $200 million, respectively. The 2013 Revolving Facility, 2014 Revolving Facility and April 2016 Revolving Facility are each subject to an undrawn annual fee of 0.63%. As of December\\xa031, 2019, there were no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the 2013 Revolving Facility, 2014 Revolving Facility or April 2016 Revolving Facility. The December 2016 Credit Facilities provide for a revolving credit facility that may be established thereunder in the future.Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, the Credit Facilities are secured by collateral, including certain spare parts, slots, route authorities, simulators and leasehold rights. American has the ability to make future modifications to the collateral pledged, subject to certain restrictions. American’s obligations under the Credit Facilities are guaranteed by AAG. American is required to maintain a certain minimum ratio of appraised value of the collateral to the outstanding loans as further described below in “Collateral-Related Covenants.”The Credit Facilities contain events of default customary for similar financings, including cross default to other material indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the outstanding obligations may be accelerated and become due and payable immediately. In addition, if a “change of control” occurs, American will (absent an amendment or waiver) be required to repay at par the loans outstanding under the Credit Facilities and terminate the 2013 Revolving Facility, 2014 Revolving Facility and April 2016 Revolving Facility and any revolving credit facility established under the December 2016 Credit Facilities. The Credit Facilities also include covenants that, among other things, require AAG to maintain a minimum aggregate liquidity (as defined in the Credit Facilities) of not less than $2.0 billion and limit the ability of AAG and its restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends and make certain other payments, make certain investments, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens on the collateral, dispose of the collateral, enter into certain affiliate transactions and engage in certain business activities, in each case subject to certain exceptions.In December 2019, due to uncertainty surrounding the timing of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft return to service, American entered into an additional short-term revolving line of credit to provide us with incremental borrowing capacity of up to $400 million. We have no present intention to borrow any amounts under this facility, which matures in September 2020 with an optional extension to December 2020.(b) EETCs2019-1 Aircraft EETCs In August 2019, American created three pass-through trusts which issued approximately $1.1 billion aggregate face amount of Series 2019-1 Class AA, Class A and Class B EETCs (the 2019-1 Aircraft EETCs) in connection with the financing of 35 aircraft previously delivered or to be delivered to American through September 2020 (the 2019-1 Aircraft). As of December\\xa031, 2019, approximately $804 million of the proceeds had been used to purchase equipment notes issued by American in connection with financing 28 aircraft under the 2019-1 Aircraft EETCs, of which $608 million was used to repay existing indebtedness. Interest and principal payments on equipment notes issued in connection with the 2019-1 Aircraft EETCs are payable semi-annually in February and August of each year, with interest payments scheduled to begin in February 2020 and with principal payments scheduled to begin (i) in the case of equipment notes with respect to any 2019-1 Aircraft owned by American at the time of issuance of the 2019-1 Aircraft EETCs, in February 2020 and (ii) in the case of equipment notes with respect to the Embraer E175 aircraft and the Airbus A321neo aircraft scheduled to be delivered after the issuance of the 2019-1 Aircraft EETCs, in August 2020 and August 2021, respectively. The remaining proceeds of approximately $293 million as of December\\xa031, 2019 were being held in escrow with a depositary for the benefit of the holders of the 2019-1 Aircraft EETCs until such time as American issues additional equipment notes with respect to the remaining 2019-1 Aircraft to the pass-through trusts, which will purchase such additional equipment notes with the escrowed funds. These escrowed funds are not guaranteed by American and are not reported as debt on its condensed consolidated balance sheet because the proceeds held by the depositary for the benefit of the holders of the 2019-1 Aircraft EETCs are not American’s assets.89NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.Certain information regarding the 2019-1 Aircraft EETC equipment notes and remaining escrowed proceeds, as of December\\xa031, 2019, is set forth in the table below.\\xa02019-1 Aircraft EETCs\\xa0Series AA\\xa0Series A\\xa0Series BAggregate principal issued$579 million\\xa0$289 million\\xa0$229 millionRemaining escrowed proceeds$155 million\\xa0$77 million\\xa0$61 millionFixed interest rate per annum3.15%\\xa03.50%\\xa03.85%Maturity dateFebruary 2032\\xa0February 2032\\xa0February 20282019-1 Engine EETCsIn June 2019, American created pass-through trusts which issued $650 million in aggregate face amount of 2019-1 Engine EETCs (the 2019-1 Engine EETCs), with maturities from June 2022 to June 2026. All of the proceeds received by such pass-through trusts from the sale of the 2019-1 Engine EETCs have been used to acquire equipment notes issued by American to the pass-through trusts. The pass-through trust certificates represent the right to payment under the equipment notes that are full-recourse obligations of American and such equipment notes are secured by spare aircraft engines currently owned and operated by American.(c) Equipment Loans and Other Notes Payable Issued in 2019 In 2019, American entered into agreements under which it borrowed $1.7 billion in connection with the financing or refinancing, as the case may be, of certain aircraft and other flight equipment, of which $643 million was used to repay existing indebtedness. Debt incurred under these agreements matures in 2023 through 2031 and bears interest at variable rates (comprised of LIBOR plus an applicable margin) averaging 3.37% at December\\xa031, 2019.(d) Senior NotesIn May 2019, AAG issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.000% senior notes due 2022 (the 5.000% senior notes). These notes bear interest at a rate of 5.000%\\xa0per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2019. The 5.000% senior notes mature on June\\xa01, 2022.The details of our 4.625% and 5.000% senior notes are shown in the table below as of December\\xa031, 2019:\\xa04.625%\\xa0Senior Notes\\xa05.000% Senior NotesAggregate principal issued and outstanding$500 million\\xa0$750 millionMaturity dateMarch 2020\\xa0June 2022Fixed interest rate per annum4.625%\\xa05.000%Interest paymentsSemi-annually in arrears in March and September\\xa0Semi-annually in arrears in June and DecemberThe 4.625% and 5.000% senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of AAG. These senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by American. The indentures for these senior notes contain covenants and events of default generally customary for similar financings. In addition, if we experience specific kinds of changes of control, we must offer to repurchase these senior notes in whole or in part at a price of 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the repurchase date. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, these senior notes may be accelerated and become due and payable.GuaranteesAs of December\\xa031, 2019, AAG had issued guarantees covering approximately $725 million of American’s special facility revenue bonds (and interest thereon) and $8.1 billion of American’s secured debt (and interest thereon), including the Credit Facilities and certain EETC financings.90NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.Collateral-Related CovenantsCertain of our debt financing agreements (including our term loans, revolving credit facilities and spare engine EETCs) contain loan to value (LTV) ratio covenants and require us to appraise the related collateral annually. Pursuant to such agreements, if the LTV ratio exceeds a specified threshold or if the value of the appraised collateral fails to meet a specified threshold, as the case may be, we are required, as applicable, to pledge additional qualifying collateral (which in some cases may include cash or investment securities), or pay down such financing, in whole or in part.Specifically, we are required to meet certain collateral coverage tests on an annual basis for our Credit Facilities, as described below:\\xa02013\\xa0Credit\\xa0Facilities\\xa02014\\xa0Credit\\xa0Facilities\\xa0April 2016 Credit Facilities\\xa0December 2016Credit FacilitiesFrequency of Appraisals of\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Appraised CollateralAnnual\\xa0Annual\\xa0Annual\\xa0AnnualLTV Requirement1.6x\\xa0Collateral valuation\\xa0to amount of debt outstanding (62.5% LTV)\\xa01.6x Collateral valuation to amount of debt outstanding (62.5% LTV)\\xa01.6x Collateral valuation to amount of debt outstanding (62.5% LTV)\\xa01.6x Collateral valuation to amount of debt outstanding (62.5% LTV)LTV as of Last Measurement\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Date36.2%\\xa017.7%\\xa036.2%\\xa053.6%Collateral DescriptionGenerally, certain slots, route authorities and airport gate leasehold rights used by American to operate all services between the U.S. and South America\\xa0Generally, certain slots, route authorities and airport gate leasehold rights used by American to operate certain services between the U.S. and European Union (including London Heathrow)\\xa0Generally, certain spare parts\\xa0Generally, certain Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) slots, certain La Guardia Airport (LGA) slots, certain simulators and certain leasehold rightsAt December\\xa031, 2019, we were in compliance with the applicable collateral coverage tests as of the most recent measurement dates.6.\\xa0\\xa0LeasesWe lease certain aircraft and engines, including aircraft under capacity purchase agreements. As of December\\xa031, 2019, we had 636 leased aircraft, with remaining terms ranging from less than one year to 12 years.At each airport where we conduct flight operations, we have agreements, generally with a governmental unit or authority, for the use of passenger, operations and baggage handling space as well as runways and taxiways. These agreements, particularly in the U.S., often contain provisions for periodic adjustments to rates and charges applicable under such agreements. These rates and charges also vary with our level of operations and the operations of the airport. Because of the variable nature of these rates, these leases are not recorded on our balance sheet as a ROU asset or a lease liability. Additionally, at our hub locations and in certain other cities we serve, we lease administrative offices, catering, cargo, training, maintenance and other facilities.91NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.The components of lease expense were as follows (in millions):\\xa0Year Ended December 31,\\xa020192018Operating lease cost$2,027\\xa0$1,907Finance lease cost:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Amortization of assets79\\xa078Interest on lease liabilities43\\xa048Variable lease cost2,558\\xa02,353Total net lease cost$4,707\\xa0$4,386Included in the table above is $236 million and $226 million of operating lease cost under our capacity purchase agreement with Republic for the years ended December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income.\\xa0We consider all available positive and negative evidence and make certain assumptions in evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets.\\xa0Many factors are considered that impact our assessment of future profitability, including conditions which are beyond our control, such as the health of the economy, the availability and price volatility of aircraft fuel and travel demand.94NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.The components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions):\\xa0December\\xa031,\\xa02019\\xa02018Deferred tax assets:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Operating loss carryforwards$2,103\\xa0$2,343Leases2,077\\xa02,189Loyalty program liability1,755\\xa01,770Pensions1,229\\xa01,430Postretirement benefits other than pensions145\\xa0145Rent expense126\\xa0136Alternative minimum tax (AMT) credit carryforwards90\\xa0175Reorganization items30\\xa033Other613\\xa0631Total deferred tax assets8,168\\xa08,852Valuation allowance(34)\\xa0(30)Net deferred tax assets8,134\\xa08,822Deferred tax liabilities:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Accelerated depreciation and amortization(5,196)\\xa0(5,280)Leases(1,979)\\xa0(2,081)Other(343)\\xa0(326)Total deferred tax liabilities(7,518)\\xa0(7,687)Net deferred tax asset$616\\xa0$1,135At December\\xa031, 2019, we had approximately $9.1 billion of federal NOLs carried over from prior taxable years (NOL Carryforwards) to reduce future federal taxable income, substantially all of which we expect to be available for use in 2020. The federal NOL Carryforwards will expire beginning in 2023 if unused. We also had approximately $3.0 billion of NOL Carryforwards to reduce future state taxable income at December\\xa031, 2019, which will expire in years 2020 through 2039 if unused. Our ability to deduct our NOL Carryforwards and to utilize certain other available tax attributes can be substantially constrained under the general annual limitation rules of Section\\xa0382 where an “ownership change” has occurred. Substantially all of our remaining federal NOL Carryforwards attributable to US Airways Group are subject to limitation under Section\\xa0382; however, our ability to utilize such NOL Carryforwards is not anticipated to be effectively constrained as a result of such limitation. We elected to be covered by certain special rules for federal income tax purposes that permitted approximately $9.0 billion (with $7.3 billion of unlimited NOL still remaining at December\\xa031, 2019) of our federal NOL Carryforwards to be utilized without regard to the annual limitation generally imposed by Section\\xa0382. Similar limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. Our ability to utilize any new NOL Carryforwards arising after the ownership changes is not affected by the annual limitation rules imposed by Section\\xa0382 unless another future ownership change occurs. Under the Section\\xa0382 limitation, cumulative stock ownership changes among material stockholders exceeding 50% during a rolling three-year period can potentially limit a company’s future use of NOLs and tax credits.At December\\xa031, 2019, we had an AMT credit carryforward of approximately $170 million available for federal income tax purposes, which is presently expected to be fully refundable over the next several years as a result of the repeal of corporate AMT as part of the 2017 Tax Act. In 2019, we recorded an income tax provision of $570 million, with an effective rate of approximately 25%, which was substantially non-cash due to utilization of our NOLs as described above. Substantially all of our income before income taxes is attributable to the United States. We file our tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our 2016 through 2018 tax years are still subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. Various state and foreign jurisdiction tax years remain open to examination and we are under examination, in administrative appeals, or engaged in tax litigation in certain jurisdictions. We believe that the effect of any assessments will not be material to our consolidated financial statements.95NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.The amount of, and changes to, our uncertain tax positions were not material in any of the years presented. We accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating expense, respectively.The 2017 Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017 and is the most comprehensive tax change in more than 30 years. We completed our evaluation of the 2017 Tax Act and we reflected the impact of its effects, including the impact of a lower corporate income tax rate (21% vs. 35%) on our deferred tax assets and liabilities and the one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred. For the year ended December 31 2017, we recognized a special income tax provision of $823 million to reflect these impacts of the 2017 Tax Act. 8.\\xa0\\xa0Risk ManagementOur economic prospects are heavily dependent upon two variables we cannot control: the health of the economy and the price of fuel.Due to the discretionary nature of business and leisure travel spending and the highly competitive nature of the airline industry, our revenues are heavily influenced by the condition of the U.S. economy and economies in other regions of the world. Unfavorable conditions in these broader economies have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased passenger demand for air travel, changes in booking practices and related reactions by our competitors, all of which in turn have had, and may have in the future, a negative effect on our business. In addition, during challenging economic times, actions by our competitors to increase their revenues can have an adverse impact on our revenues.Our operating results are materially impacted by changes in the availability, price volatility and cost of aircraft fuel, which represents one of the largest single cost items in our business. Aircraft fuel prices have in the past, and may in the future, experience substantial volatility. Because of the amount of fuel needed to operate our business, even a relatively small increase or decrease in the price of aircraft fuel can have a material effect on our operating results and liquidity.These additional factors could impact our results of operations, financial performance and liquidity:(a) Credit RiskMost of our receivables relate to tickets sold to individual passengers through the use of major credit cards or to tickets sold by other airlines and used by passengers on American. These receivables are short-term, mostly settled within seven days after sale. Bad debt losses, which have been minimal in the past, have been considered in establishing allowances for doubtful accounts. We do not believe we are subject to any significant concentration of credit risk.(b) Interest Rate RiskWe have exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to our variable-rate debt obligations. Interest rates on $9.6 billion principal amount of long-term debt as of December\\xa031, 2019 are subject to adjustment to reflect changes in floating interest rates. The weighted average effective interest rate on our variable-rate debt was 3.6% at December\\xa031, 2019. We currently do not have an interest rate hedge program to hedge our exposure to floating interest rates on our variable-rate debt obligations.(c) Foreign Currency RiskWe are exposed to the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency-denominated transactions. Our largest exposure comes from the British pound, Euro, Canadian dollar and various Latin American currencies, primarily the Brazilian real. We do not currently have a foreign currency hedge program.96NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.9.\\xa0\\xa0Fair Value Measurements and Other InvestmentsAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisFair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e. an exit price) on the measurement date in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability. Accounting standards include disclosure requirements around fair values used for certain financial instruments and establish a fair value hierarchy. The hierarchy prioritizes valuation inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Each fair value measurement is reported in one of three levels:•Level 1\\xa0–\\xa0Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;•Level 2\\xa0–\\xa0Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and•Level 3\\xa0–\\xa0Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.When available, we use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of our financial assets. If quoted market prices are not available, we measure fair value using valuation techniques that use, when possible, current market-based or independently-sourced market parameters, such as interest rates and currency rates.We utilize the market approach to measure the fair value of our financial assets.

The defined benefit pension plans provide benefits for participating employees based on years of service and average compensation for a specified period of time before retirement. Effective November\\xa01, 2012, substantially all of our defined benefit pension plans were frozen and we began providing enhanced benefits under our defined contribution pension plans for certain employee groups. We use a December\\xa031 measurement date for all of our defined benefit pension plans. We also provide certain retiree medical and other postretirement benefits, including health care and life insurance benefits, to retired employees. Effective November\\xa01, 2012, we modified our retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans to eliminate the company subsidy for employees who retire on or after November\\xa01, 2012. As a result of modifications to our retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans in 2012, we recognized a negative plan amendment of $1.9 billion, which is included as a component of prior service benefit in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) and will be amortized over the future service life of the active plan participants for whom the benefit was eliminated, or approximately eight years. As of December\\xa031, 2019, $150 million of prior service benefit remains, which will be fully amortized in 2020.

Expected returns on long duration bonds are based on yields to maturity of the bonds held at year-end. Expected returns on other assets are based on a combination of long-term historical returns, actual returns on plan assets achieved over the last ten years, current and expected market conditions, and expected value to be generated through active management and securities lending programs.A one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following approximate effects on our retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans (in millions):\\xa01%\\xa0Increase\\xa01%\\xa0DecreaseIncrease (decrease) on 2019 service and interest cost$1\\xa0$(1)Increase (decrease) on benefit obligation as of December\\xa031, 201940\\xa0(40)Minimum ContributionsWe are required to make minimum contributions to our defined benefit pension plans under the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and various other laws for U.S. based plans as well as underfunding rules specific to countries where we maintain defined benefit plans. Based on current funding assumptions, we have minimum required contributions of $196 million for 2020 including contributions to defined benefit plans for our wholly-owned regional subsidiaries. Our funding obligations will depend on the performance of our investments held in trust by the pension plans, interest rates for determining liabilities, the amount of and timing of any supplemental contributions and our actuarial experience.Benefit PaymentsThe following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service as appropriate, are expected to be paid (approximately, in millions):\\xa02020\\xa02021\\xa02022\\xa02023\\xa02024\\xa02025-2029Pension benefits$753\\xa0$792\\xa0$832\\xa0$874\\xa0$914\\xa0$5,045Retiree medical and other postretirement benefits80\\xa071\\xa066\\xa064\\xa061\\xa0265101NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.Plan AssetsThe objectives of our investment policies are to: maintain sufficient income and liquidity to pay retirement benefits; produce a long-term rate of return that meets or exceeds the assumed rate of return for plan assets; limit the volatility of asset performance and funded status; and diversify assets among asset classes and investment managers.Based on these investment objectives, a long-term strategic asset allocation has been established. This strategic allocation seeks to balance the potential benefit of improving the funded position with the potential risk that the funded position would decline. The current strategic target asset allocation is as follows:Asset Class/Sub-ClassAllowed RangeEquity45%\\xa0-\\xa080%Public:\\xa0U.S. Large15%\\xa0-\\xa040%U.S. Small/Mid2%\\xa0-\\xa010%International10%\\xa0-\\xa025%Emerging Markets2%\\xa0-\\xa015%Alternative Investments5%\\xa0-\\xa030%Fixed Income20%\\xa0-\\xa055%Public:\\xa0U.S. Long Duration15%\\xa0-\\xa045%High Yield and Emerging Markets0%\\xa0-\\xa010%Private Income0%\\xa0-\\xa010%Other0%\\xa0-\\xa05%Cash Equivalents0%\\xa0-\\xa020%Public equity as well as high yield and emerging market fixed income securities are used to provide diversification and are expected to generate higher returns over the long-term than U.S. long duration bonds. Public stocks are managed using a value investment approach in order to participate in the returns generated by stocks in the long-term, while reducing year-over-year volatility. U.S. long duration bonds are used to partially hedge the assets from declines in interest rates. Alternative (private) investments are used to provide expected returns in excess of the public markets over the long-term. The pension plan’s master trust also participates in securities lending programs to generate additional income by loaning plan assets to borrowers on a fully collateralized basis. These programs are subject to market risk.Investments in securities traded on recognized securities exchanges are valued at the last reported sales price on the last business day of the year. Securities traded in the over-the-counter market are valued at the last bid price. The money market fund is valued at fair value which represents the net asset value of the shares of such fund as of the close of business at the end of the period. Investments in limited partnerships are carried at estimated net asset value as determined by and reported by the general partners of the partnerships and represent the proportionate share of the estimated fair value of the underlying assets of the limited partnerships. Common/collective trusts are valued at net asset value based on the fair values of the underlying investments of the trusts as determined by the sponsor of the trusts. The pension plan’s master trust also invests in a 103-12 investment entity (the 103-12 Investment Trust) which is designed to invest plan assets of more than one unrelated employer. The 103-12 Investment Trust is valued at net asset value which is determined by the issuer daily and is based on the aggregate fair value of trust assets less liabilities, divided by the number of units outstanding. No changes in valuation techniques or inputs occurred during the year.102NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.Benefit Plan Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisThe fair value of our pension plan assets at December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, by asset category, were as follows (in millions):\\xa0Fair Value Measurements as of December\\xa031, 2019Asset CategoryQuoted\\xa0Prices\\xa0inActive Marketsfor IdenticalAssets(Level\\xa01)\\xa0SignificantObservableInputs(Level\\xa02)\\xa0SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level\\xa03)\\xa0TotalCash and cash equivalents$20\\xa0$—\\xa0$—\\xa0$20Equity securities:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0International markets (a), (b)2,769\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa02,769Large-cap companies (b)2,312\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa02,312Mid-cap companies (b)543\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0543Small-cap companies (b)97\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa097Mutual funds (c)68\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa068Fixed income:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Corporate debt (d)—\\xa02,804\\xa0—\\xa02,804Government securities (e)—\\xa0923\\xa0—\\xa0923U.S. municipal securities—\\xa051\\xa0—\\xa051Mortgage backed securities—\\xa04\\xa0—\\xa04Alternative instruments:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Private market partnerships (f)—\\xa0—\\xa010\\xa010Private market partnerships measured at net asset value (f), (g)—\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa01,464Common/collective trusts (h)—\\xa0358\\xa0—\\xa0358Common/collective trusts and 103-12 Investment Trust measured at net asset value (g), (h)—\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa01,423Insurance group annuity contracts—\\xa0—\\xa02\\xa02Dividend and interest receivable53\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa053Due to/from brokers for sale of securities\\xa0–\\xa0net(4)\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0(4)Total$5,858\\xa0$4,140\\xa0$12\\xa0$12,897\\xa0(a)\\xa0Holdings are diversified as follows: 14% United Kingdom, 8% Switzerland, 8% Ireland, 7% Japan, 7% France, 6% South Korea, 6% Canada, 18% emerging markets and the remaining 26% with no concentration greater than 5% in any one country.(b)\\xa0There are no significant concentrations of holdings by company or industry.(c)\\xa0Investment includes mutual funds invested 40% in equity securities of large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap U.S. companies, 33% in U.S. treasuries and corporate bonds and 27% in equity securities of international companies.(d)\\xa0Includes approximately 76% investments in corporate debt with a S&P rating lower than A and 24% investments in corporate debt with a S&P rating A or higher.

Investments included approximately 24% and 30% of investments in non-U.S. common stocks in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net asset value is based on the fair market value of the funds’ underlying assets and liabilities at the date of determination.Defined Contribution and Multiemployer PlansThe costs associated with our defined contribution plans were $860 million, $846 million and $820 million for the years ended December\\xa031, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.We participate in the International Association of Machinists & Aerospace Workers (IAM) National Pension Fund, Employer Identification No. 51-6031295 and Plan No. 002 (the IAM Pension Fund). Our contributions to the IAM Pension Fund were $32 million, $31 million and $31 million for the years ended December\\xa031, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The IAM Pension Fund reported $467 million in employers’ contributions for the year ended December\\xa031, 2018, which is the most recent year for which such information is available. For 2018, our contributions represented more than 5% of total contributions to the IAM Pension Fund.On March 29, 2019, the actuary for the IAM Pension Fund certified that the fund was in endangered status despite reporting a funded status of over 80%. Additionally, the IAM Pension Fund’s Board voluntarily elected to enter into critical status on April 17, 2019. In connection with the entry into critical status, the IAM Pension Fund adopted a rehabilitation plan on April 17, 2019 (the Rehabilitation Plan). Under the Rehabilitation Plan, we were subject to an immaterial contribution surcharge, which ceased to apply June 14, 2019 upon our adoption of a contribution schedule under the Rehabilitation Plan. The contribution schedule we adopted provides for 2.5% annual increases to our contribution rate. This contribution schedule will remain in effect through the earlier of December 31, 2031 or the date the IAM Pension Fund emerges from critical status. Profit Sharing ProgramWe accrue 5% of our pre-tax income excluding net special items for our profit sharing program. For the year ended December\\xa031, 2019, we accrued $213 million for this program, which will be distributed to employees in the first quarter of 2020.106NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.11.\\xa0\\xa0Accumulated Other Comprehensive LossThe components of AOCI are as follows (in millions):\\xa0Pension,RetireeMedical andOtherPostretirementBenefits\\xa0Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments\\xa0Income TaxBenefit(Provision)\\xa0(1)\\xa0TotalBalance at December\\xa031, 2017$(4,523)\\xa0$(1)\\xa0$(1,252)\\xa0$(5,776)Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications(62)\\xa0(4)\\xa015\\xa0(51)Amounts reclassified from AOCI(88)\\xa0—\\xa019(2)\\xa0(69)Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss)(150)\\xa0(4)\\xa034\\xa0(120)Balance at December\\xa031, 2018(4,673)\\xa0(5)\\xa0(1,218)\\xa0(5,896)Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications(476)\\xa03\\xa0107\\xa0(366)Amounts reclassified from AOCI(89)\\xa0—\\xa020(2)\\xa0(69)Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss)(565)\\xa03\\xa0127\\xa0(435)Balance at December\\xa031, 2019$(5,238)\\xa0$(2)\\xa0$(1,091)\\xa0$(6,331)\\xa0(1)\\xa0Relates principally to pension, retiree medical and other postretirement benefits obligations that will not be recognized in net income until the obligations are fully extinguished.(2)\\xa0Relates to pension, retiree medical and other postretirement benefits obligations and is recognized within the income tax provision on our consolidated statements of operations.Reclassifications out of AOCI for the years ended December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018 are as follows (in millions):\\xa0Amounts\\xa0reclassified\\xa0from\\xa0AOCI\\xa0Affected line items on theconsolidated statements ofoperations\\xa0Year Ended December\\xa031,\\xa0AOCI Components2019\\xa02018\\xa0Amortization of pension, retiree medical and other postretirement benefits:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Prior service benefit$(162)\\xa0$(161)\\xa0Nonoperating other income, netActuarial loss93\\xa092\\xa0Nonoperating other income, netTotal reclassifications for the period, net of tax$(69)\\xa0$(69)\\xa0\\xa0Amounts allocated to other comprehensive income for income taxes as further described in Note 7 will remain in AOCI until we cease all related activities, such as termination of the pension plan.12.\\xa0\\xa0Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees(a) Aircraft, Engine and Other Purchase CommitmentsUnder all of our aircraft and engine purchase agreements, our total future commitments as of December\\xa031, 2019 are expected to be as follows (approximately, in millions):\\xa02020\\xa02021\\xa02022\\xa02023\\xa02024\\xa02025 and Thereafter\\xa0TotalPayments for aircraft commitments and certain engines (1)$1,629\\xa0$750\\xa0$1,599\\xa0$1,543\\xa0$2,574\\xa0$4,855\\xa0$12,950\\xa0(1)\\xa0These amounts are net of purchase deposits currently held by the manufacturers. We have granted a security interest in certain of our purchase deposits with Boeing. Our purchase deposits held by all manufacturers totaled $1.7 billion as of December\\xa031, 2019.107NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.On March 13, 2019, a directive from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded all U.S.-registered Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. We currently have 76 Boeing 737 MAX Family aircraft on order and we have not taken delivery of any Boeing 737 MAX Family aircraft since the grounding. The extent of the delay to the scheduled deliveries of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft is expected to be impacted by the length of time the FAA order remains in place, Boeing's production rate and the pace at which Boeing can deliver aircraft following the lifting of the FAA order, among other factors. Due to uncertainty surrounding the timing of delivery of certain aircraft, the amounts in the table represent our current best estimate, including with respect to the delivery of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft; however, the actual delivery schedule may differ from the table above, potentially materially. The amounts in the table exclude 22 787-8 aircraft to be delivered in 2020 and 2021 for which Boeing has committed to provide sale-leaseback financing (in the form of operating leases). See Note 6 for information regarding this operating lease commitment.Additionally, we have purchase commitments related to aircraft fuel, construction projects and information technology support as follows (approximately): $3.5 billion in 2020, $3.5 billion in 2021, $1.3 billion in 2022, $130 million in 2023, $81 million in 2024 and $77 million in 2025 and thereafter.(b) Capacity Purchase Agreements with Third-Party Regional CarriersAmerican has capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers. The capacity purchase agreements provide that all revenues, including passenger, in-flight, ancillary, mail and freight revenues, go to American. American controls marketing, scheduling, ticketing, pricing and seat inventories. In return, American agrees to pay predetermined fees to these airlines for operating an agreed-upon number of aircraft, without regard to the number of passengers on board. In addition, these agreements provide that American either reimburses or pays 100% of certain variable costs, such as airport landing fees, fuel and passenger liability insurance. As of December\\xa031, 2019, American’s capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers had expiration dates ranging from 2020 to 2032, with rights of American to extend the respective terms of certain agreements.As of December\\xa031, 2019, American’s minimum obligations under its capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers are as follows (approximately, in millions):\\xa02020\\xa02021\\xa02022\\xa02023\\xa02024\\xa02025 and Thereafter\\xa0TotalMinimum obligations under capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers (1)$1,115\\xa0$1,185\\xa0$1,126\\xa0$1,077\\xa0$1,077\\xa0$3,402\\xa0$8,982\\xa0(1)\\xa0Represents minimum payments under capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers, which are estimates of costs based on assumed minimum levels of flying under the capacity purchase agreements and American’s actual payments could differ materially. Excludes payments for the lease of certain aircraft under capacity purchase agreements, which are reflected in the operating lease obligations in Note 6. (c) Airport RedevelopmentLos Angeles International Airport (LAX)In 2018, we executed a lease agreement with Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA), which owns and operates LAX, in connection with a $1.6 billion modernization project related to LAX Terminals 4 and 5. Construction will occur in a phased approach, which started in October 2018 and is expected to be completed in 2028. The modernization project will include a unified departure hall to combine the entranceway of Terminals 4 and 5, reconfigured ticket counter and check-in areas with seamless access to security screening areas, 16 security screening lanes with automated technology and upgraded amenities at gate areas. The project will also include renovated break rooms, multi-use meeting rooms and team gathering spaces throughout the terminals to support our team members at LAX.We are managing this project and have legal title to the assets during their construction. As each phase is completed, the assets will be sold and transferred to LAWA, including the site improvements and non-proprietary improvements. As we control the assets during construction, they are recognized on our balance sheet until legal title has transferred. For 2019, we incurred approximately $98 million in costs relating to the LAX modernization project, which are included within operating property and equipment on our consolidated balance sheet as of December\\xa031, 2019.108NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.(d) Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAircraft and EnginesAmerican currently operates 382 owned aircraft and 69 leased aircraft, and owns 79 spare aircraft engines, which in each case were financed with EETCs issued by pass-through trusts. These trusts are off-balance sheet entities, the primary purpose of which is to finance the acquisition of flight equipment or to permit issuance of debt backed by existing flight equipment. In the case of aircraft EETCs, rather than finance each aircraft separately when such aircraft is purchased, delivered or refinanced, these trusts allow American to raise the financing for a number of aircraft at one time and, if applicable, place such funds in escrow pending a future purchase, delivery or refinancing of the relevant aircraft. Similarly, in the case of the spare engine EETCs, the trust allows American to use its existing pool of spare engines to raise financing under a single facility. The trusts have also been structured to provide for certain credit enhancements, such as liquidity facilities to cover certain interest payments, that reduce the risks to the purchasers of the trust certificates and, as a result, reduce the cost of aircraft financing to American.Each trust covers a set number of aircraft or spare engines scheduled to be delivered, financed or refinanced upon the issuance of the EETC or within a specific period of time thereafter. At the time of each covered aircraft or spare engine financing, the relevant trust used the proceeds of the issuance of the EETC (which may have been available at the time of issuance thereof or held in escrow until financing of the applicable aircraft following its delivery) to purchase equipment notes relating to the financed aircraft or engines. The equipment notes are issued, at American’s election, in connection with a mortgage financing of the aircraft or spare engines or, in certain cases, by a separate owner trust in connection with a leveraged lease financing of the aircraft. In the case of a leveraged lease financing, the owner trust then leases the aircraft to American. In both cases, the equipment notes are secured by a security interest in the aircraft or engines, as applicable. The pass-through trust certificates are not direct obligations of, nor are they guaranteed by, AAG or American. However, in the case of mortgage financings, the equipment notes issued to the trusts are direct obligations of American and, in certain instances, have been guaranteed by AAG. As of December\\xa031, 2019, $11.9 billion associated with these mortgage financings is reflected as debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.With respect to leveraged leases, American evaluated whether the leases had characteristics of a variable interest entity. American concluded the leasing entities met the criteria for variable interest entities; however, American concluded it is not the primary beneficiary under these leasing arrangements and accounts for the majority of its EETC leveraged lease financings as operating leases. American’s total future payments to the trusts of each of the relevant EETCs under these leveraged lease financings are $177 million as of December\\xa031, 2019, which are reflected in the operating lease obligations in Note 6.Letters of Credit and OtherWe provide financial assurance, such as letters of credit, surety bonds or restricted cash and investments, primarily to support projected workers’ compensation obligations and airport commitments. As of December\\xa031, 2019, we had $572 million of letters of credit and surety bonds securing various obligations. The letters of credit and surety bonds that are subject to expiration will expire on various dates through 2022.(e) Legal ProceedingsChapter 11 Cases. On November\\xa029, 2011, AMR, American, and certain of AMR’s other direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries (the Debtors) filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). On October\\xa021, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving and confirming the Debtors’ fourth amended joint plan of reorganization (as amended, the Plan). On the Effective Date, December\\xa09, 2013, the Debtors consummated their reorganization pursuant to the Plan and completed the Merger.Pursuant to rulings of the Bankruptcy Court, the Plan established the Disputed Claims Reserve to hold shares of AAG common stock reserved for issuance to disputed claimholders at the Effective Date that ultimately become holders of allowed claims. The shares of AAG common stock issued to the Disputed Claims Reserve were originally issued on December\\xa013, 2013 and have at all times since been included in the number of shares issued and outstanding as reported from time to time in our quarterly and annual reports, including for purposes of calculating earnings per common share. As disputed claims are resolved, the claimants receive distributions of shares from the Disputed Claims Reserve. However, we are not required to distribute additional shares above the limits contemplated by the Plan, even if the shares remaining for distribution in the Disputed Claims Reserve are not sufficient to fully pay any additional allowed unsecured claims. To the extent that any of the reserved shares remain undistributed upon resolution of all remaining disputed claims, such shares will not be returned to us but rather will be distributed to former AMR stockholders and former convertible noteholders treated as stockholders 109NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.under the Plan. As of December\\xa031, 2019, the Disputed Claims Reserve held approximately 7 million shares of AAG common stock.Private Party Antitrust Action Related to Passenger Capacity. We, along with Delta Air Lines, Inc., Southwest Airlines Co., United Airlines, Inc. and, in the case of litigation filed in Canada, Air Canada, were named as defendants in approximately 100 putative class action lawsuits alleging unlawful agreements with respect to air passenger capacity. The U.S. lawsuits were consolidated in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia (the DC Court). On June 15, 2018, we reached a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs in the amount of $45 million to resolve all class claims in the U.S. lawsuits. That settlement was approved by the DC Court on May 13, 2019. Three parties who objected to the settlement have appealed that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. We believe these appeals are without merit and intend to vigorously defend against them. Private Party Antitrust Action Related to the Merger. On August\\xa06, 2013, a lawsuit captioned Carolyn Fjord, et al., v. AMR Corporation, et al., was filed in the Bankruptcy Court. The complaint named as defendants US Airways Group, US Airways, AMR and American, alleged that the effect of the Merger may be to create a monopoly in violation of Section\\xa07 of the Clayton Antitrust Act, and sought injunctive relief and/or divestiture. On November\\xa027, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court denied plaintiffs’ motion to preliminarily enjoin the Merger. On August 29, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court denied in part defendants' motion for summary judgment, and fully denied plaintiffs' cross-motion for summary judgment. The parties' evidentiary cases were presented before the Bankruptcy Court in a bench trial in March 2019. The parties submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law and made closing arguments in April 2019, and we are awaiting the Bankruptcy Court's decision. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend against the allegations.Pension Benefits Action. On December 11, 2018, a lawsuit captioned Torres, et al. v. American Airlines, Inc., The Employee Benefits Committee and John/Jane Does 1-5, was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas.  The plaintiffs in this lawsuit purport to represent a class consisting of all participants in and beneficiaries under any of the four American defined benefit pension plans who elected to receive an optional form of benefit other than a lump sum distribution of a participant’s vested benefit. Under ERISA, participants covered by defined benefit plans accrue retirement benefits in the form of a single life annuity payable upon retirement on a monthly basis until the employee’s death, and may elect certain alternative forms of benefit payments. Plaintiffs contend that the mortality tables used by American for purposes of calculations related to these alternative forms of benefits are outdated and that more recent mortality tables would have provided more generous benefits and should have been used to make those calculations. The court has denied our motion to dismiss the complaint. We believe this lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend against the allegations.General. In addition to the specifically identified legal proceedings, we and our subsidiaries are also engaged in other legal proceedings from time to time.\\xa0Legal proceedings can be complex and take many months, or even years, to reach resolution, with the final outcome depending on a number of variables, some of which are not within our control. Therefore, although we will vigorously defend ourselves in each of the actions described above and such other legal proceedings, their ultimate resolution and potential financial and other impacts on us are uncertain but could be material.(f) Guarantees and IndemnificationsWe are party to many routine contracts in which we provide general indemnities in the normal course of business to third parties for various risks. We are not able to estimate the potential amount of any liability resulting from the indemnities. These indemnities are discussed in the following paragraphs.In our aircraft financing agreements, we generally indemnify the financing parties, trustees acting on their behalf and other relevant parties against liabilities (including certain taxes) resulting from the financing, manufacture, design, ownership, operation and maintenance of the aircraft regardless of whether these liabilities (including certain taxes) relate to the negligence of the indemnified parties.Our loan agreements and other LIBOR-based financing transactions (including certain leveraged aircraft leases) generally obligate us to reimburse the applicable lender for incremental costs due to a change in law that imposes (i)\\xa0any reserve or special deposit requirement against assets of, deposits with or credit extended by such lender related to the loan, (ii)\\xa0any tax, duty or other charge with respect to the loan (except standard income tax) or (iii)\\xa0capital adequacy requirements. In addition, our loan agreements and other financing arrangements typically contain a withholding tax provision that requires us to pay additional amounts to the applicable lender or other financing party, generally if withholding taxes are imposed on such lender or other financing party as a result of a change in the applicable tax law.110NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.In certain transactions, including certain aircraft financing leases and loans, the lessors, lenders and/or other parties have rights to terminate the transaction based on changes in foreign tax law, illegality or certain other events or circumstances. In such a case, we may be required to make a lump sum payment to terminate the relevant transaction.We have general indemnity clauses in many of our airport and other real estate leases where we as lessee indemnify the lessor (and related parties) against liabilities related to our use of the leased property. Generally, these indemnifications cover liabilities resulting from the negligence of the indemnified parties, but not liabilities resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the indemnified parties. In addition, we provide environmental indemnities in many of these leases for contamination related to our use of the leased property.Under certain contracts with third parties, we indemnify the third-party against legal liability arising out of an action by the third-party, or certain other parties. The terms of these contracts vary and the potential exposure under these indemnities cannot be determined. We have liability insurance protecting us for some of the obligations we have undertaken under these indemnities.American is required to make principal and interest payments for certain special facility revenue bonds issued by municipalities primarily to build or improve airport facilities and purchase equipment, which are leased to American. The payment of principal and interest of certain special facility revenue bonds is guaranteed by AAG. As of December\\xa031, 2019, the remaining lease payments through 2035 guaranteeing the principal and interest on these bonds are $589 million and the current carrying amount of the associated operating lease liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet is $321 million. As of December\\xa031, 2019, AAG had issued guarantees covering approximately $725 million of American’s special facility revenue bonds (and interest thereon) and $8.1 billion of American’s secured debt (and interest thereon), including the Credit Facilities and certain EETC financings.(g) Credit Card Processing AgreementsWe have agreements with companies that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services. Our agreements allow these credit card processing companies, under certain conditions, to hold an amount of our cash (referred to as a holdback) equal to a portion of advance ticket sales that have been processed by that company, but for which we have not yet provided the air transportation. Additional holdback requirements in the event of material adverse changes in our financial condition will reduce our liquidity in the form of unrestricted cash by the amount of the holdbacks. These credit card processing companies are not currently entitled to maintain any holdbacks pursuant to these requirements.(h) Labor NegotiationsAs of December\\xa031, 2019, we employed approximately 133,700 active full-time equivalent employees, of which 29,500 were employed by our regional operations. Approximately 85% of employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) with various labor unions and approximately 22% of employees are covered by CBAs that will become amendable within one year. Agreements in principle were reached on January 30, 2020 for joint collective bargaining agreements (JCBAs) covering our mainline maintenance, fleet service, stock clerks, maintenance control technicians and maintenance training instructors. Those agreements are subject to membership ratification vote. Additionally, the post-Merger JCBAs covering our pilots and flight attendants became amendable in January 2020 and December 2019, respectively. Negotiations continue for new agreements for these workgroups as well as for CBAs covering certain employee groups at our wholly-owned regional subsidiaries.13.\\xa0\\xa0Supplemental Cash Flow InformationSupplemental disclosure of cash flow information and non-cash investing and financing activities are as follows (in millions):\\xa0Year\\xa0Ended\\xa0December\\xa031,\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017Non-cash investing and financing activities:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Settlement of bankruptcy obligations$7\\xa0$—\\xa0$15Equity Investment—\\xa0—\\xa0120Supplemental information:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Interest paid, net1,111\\xa01,091\\xa01,040Income taxes paid8\\xa018\\xa020111NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.14.\\xa0\\xa0Operating Segments and Related DisclosuresWe are managed as a single business unit that provides air transportation for passengers and cargo. This allows us to benefit from an integrated revenue pricing and route network that includes American and our wholly-owned and third-party regional carriers that fly under capacity purchase agreements operating as American Eagle. The flight equipment of all these carriers is combined to form one fleet that is deployed through a single route scheduling system. Financial information and annual operational plans and forecasts are prepared and reviewed by the chief operating decision maker at the consolidated level. When making operational decisions, the chief operating decision maker evaluates flight profitability data, which considers aircraft type and route economics, but is indifferent to the results of the individual wholly-owned regional carriers. The objective in making operational decisions is to maximize consolidated financial results, not the individual results of American or American Eagle. See Note 1(k) for our passenger revenue by geographic region. Our tangible assets consist primarily of flight equipment, which are mobile across geographic markets and, therefore, have not been allocated.15.\\xa0\\xa0Share-based CompensationThe 2013 AAG Incentive Award Plan (the 2013 Plan) provides that awards may be in the form of an option, restricted stock award, restricted stock unit award, performance award, dividend equivalent award, deferred stock award, deferred stock unit award, stock payment award or stock appreciation right. The 2013 Plan initially authorized the grant of awards for the issuance of up to 40 million shares. Any shares underlying awards granted under the 2013 Plan that are forfeited, terminate or are settled in cash (in whole or in part) without the delivery of shares will again be available for grant.Our salaries, wages and benefits expense for the years ended December\\xa031, 2019, 2018 and 2017 included $95 million, $88 million and $90 million, respectively, of share-based compensation costs. During 2019, 2018 and 2017, we withheld approximately 0.8 million, 0.8 million and 1.1 million shares of AAG common stock, respectively, and paid approximately $25 million, $37 million and $51 million, respectively, in satisfaction of certain tax withholding obligations associated with employee equity awards.Restricted Stock Unit Awards (RSUs)The majority of our RSUs have service conditions (time vested primarily over three years). The grant-date fair value of these RSUs is equal to the market price of the underlying shares of AAG common stock on the date of grant. The expense for these RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for the entire award.

In addition, the maturity date for the 2014 Term Loan Facility was extended to January 2027 from October 2021.\\xa0The 2014 Revolving Facility remains unchanged and, as of January 29, 2020, the effective date of the Eighth Amendment, there were no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding thereunder.114ITEM\\xa08B.\\xa0CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC.Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Stockholder and Board of DirectorsAmerican Airlines, Inc.:Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American Airlines, Inc. and\\xa0subsidiaries (American) as of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholder’s equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December\\xa031, 2019, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of American as of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December\\xa031, 2019, in conformity with U.S.\\xa0generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), American’s internal control over financial reporting as of December\\xa031, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February\\xa019, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of American’s internal control over financial reporting.Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, American has changed its method of accounting for leases as of January 1, 2018 due to the modified retrospective adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), as amended.Basis for OpinionThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of American’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to American in accordance with the U.S.\\xa0federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.115Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Evaluation of estimated passenger travel revenueAs discussed in Note 1(k) to the consolidated financial statements, American recorded passenger travel revenue of $38.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Passenger travel revenue includes an estimate for the amount of revenue recognized for tickets that will expire unused in whole or in part. The percentage of passenger tickets that are expected to expire unused is estimated based on an analysis of American’s historical data.We identified the evaluation of estimated passenger travel revenue as a critical audit matter. A high degree of auditor judgment was required to assess the underlying assumption made by American to develop this estimate. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over American’s passenger revenue recognition process, including controls related to the estimation of the percentage of passenger tickets that are expected to expire unused. We assessed American’s estimate of the percentage of passenger tickets expected to expire unused by comparing previous years’ estimates to the actual percentage of passenger tickets expired unused for the year. We evaluated the estimated amount of revenue recorded in the current year related to passenger tickets that are expected to expire unused by developing an independent expectation using actual historical ticket expirations. We compared our independent expectation to that of American. Assessment of the estimated selling price for mileage credits earned through travelAs discussed in Note 1(k) to the consolidated financial statements, American applies a relative selling price approach whereby the total amount collected from each applicable passenger ticket sale is allocated between the air transportation and the mileage credits earned. The mileage credits earned are deferred and recognized in passenger revenue at the time mileage credits are redeemed and transportation is provided. American estimates the selling price of mileage credits earned through travel using an approach based on inputs and assumptions derived from historical data. Additionally, an adjustment is made to the estimated selling price of mileage credits earned to account for the estimate of mileage credits not expected to be redeemed. American’s loyalty program liability was $8.6 billion as of December 31, 2019, and the associated passenger revenue for mileage credits redeemed for travel was $3.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019.  We identified the assessment of the estimated selling price for mileage credits earned through travel, including the estimated number of mileage credits not expected to be redeemed, as a critical audit matter. A high degree of auditor judgment was required to evaluate the historical data used to develop the estimate. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over American’s loyalty program accounting process, including controls related to the estimation of the selling price for mileage credits earned through travel. We evaluated that American’s methodology used to develop the estimated selling price of mileage credits earned through travel, including estimated mileage credits not expected to be redeemed, was consistent with that of historical periods. We performed sensitivity analyses over the estimated selling price of mileage credits earned through travel, including estimated mileage credits not expected to be redeemed. We assessed the results of the sensitivity analyses to American’s recorded amount of loyalty program liability and the associated passenger revenue.  We compared American’s estimate of mileage credits not expected to be redeemed to that of other airlines within the industry./s/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0KPMG LLPWe have served as American’s auditor since 2014.

INC.1.\\xa0\\xa0Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies(a) Basis of PresentationAmerican Airlines, Inc. (American) is a Delaware corporation whose primary business activity is the operation of a major network air carrier. American is the principal wholly-owned subsidiary of American Airlines Group Inc. (AAG), which owns all of American’s outstanding common stock, par value $1.00 per share. On December 9, 2013, a subsidiary of AMR Corporation (AMR) merged with and into US Airways Group, Inc. (US Airways Group), a Delaware corporation, which survived as a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAG, and AAG emerged from Chapter 11 (the Merger). Upon closing of the Merger and emergence from Chapter 11, AMR changed its name to American Airlines Group Inc. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The most significant areas of judgment relate to passenger revenue recognition, impairment of goodwill, impairment of long-lived and intangible assets, the loyalty program, as well as pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits.(b) Recent Accounting PronouncementsASU 2016-02: Leases (Topic 842) (the New Lease Standard)The New Lease Standard requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use (ROU) asset on the balance sheet for operating leases. Accounting for finance leases is substantially unchanged. The New Lease Standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December\\xa015, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.In the fourth quarter of 2018, American elected to early adopt the New Lease Standard as of January 1, 2018 using a modified retrospective transition, with the cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the effective date (the effective date method). Under the effective date method, financial results reported in periods prior to 2018 are unchanged. American also elected the package of practical expedients, which among other things, does not require reassessment of lease classification.The adoption of the New Lease Standard had a significant impact on American’s consolidated balance sheet due to the recognition of approximately $10 billion of lease liabilities with corresponding right-of-use assets for operating leases.Additionally, American recognized a $197 million cumulative effect adjustment credit, net of tax, to retained earnings. The adjustment to retained earnings was driven principally by sale-leaseback transactions including the recognition of unamortized deferred aircraft sale-leaseback gains. Prior to the adoption of the New Lease Standard, gains on sale-leaseback transactions were generally deferred and recognized in the income statement over the lease term. Under the New Lease Standard, gains on sale-leaseback transactions (subject to adjustment for off-market terms) are recognized immediately.ASU 2018-02: Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive IncomeThis ASU provides the option to reclassify stranded tax effects within accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings due to the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate change as a result of H.R. 1, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Act). The amount of the reclassification is the difference between the amount initially charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income at the previous U.S. federal corporate income tax rate that remains in accumulated other comprehensive income and the amount that would have been charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income using the newly enacted U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, excluding the effect of any valuation allowance previously charged to income from continuing operations. This standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. In the first quarter of 2019, American adopted this standard retrospectively as of December 22, 2017, the date the 2017 Tax Act was enacted, which resulted in the recast of prior reporting periods. As a result of the adoption, American reclassified $622 million of stranded tax effects principally related to its pension plans from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings.122NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC.ASU 2016-13: Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326)This ASU requires the use of an expected loss model for certain types of financial instruments and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to calculate credit loss estimates. For trade receivables, loans and held-to-maturity debt securities, an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses is required. For available-for-sale debt securities, an allowance for credit losses will be required rather than a reduction to the carrying value of the asset. This standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. While American has not completed its evaluation of the impact of adoption of this standard, American does not expect it to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.(c) Short-term InvestmentsShort-term investments are classified as available-for-sale and stated at fair value. Realized gains and losses are recorded in nonoperating expense on American’s consolidated statements of operations. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on American’s consolidated balance sheets.(d) Restricted Cash and Short-term InvestmentsAmerican has restricted cash and short-term investments related primarily to collateral held to support workers’ compensation obligations.(e) Aircraft Fuel, Spare Parts and Supplies, NetAircraft fuel is recorded on a first-in, first-out basis. Spare parts and supplies are recorded at average costs less an allowance for obsolescence. These items are expensed when used.(f) Operating Property and EquipmentOperating property and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated or amortized to residual values over the asset’s estimated useful life or the lease term, whichever is less, using the straight-line method. Residual values for aircraft, engines and related rotable parts are generally 5% to 10% of original cost. Costs of major improvements that enhance the usefulness of the asset are capitalized and depreciated or amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term, whichever is less. The estimated useful lives for the principal property and equipment classifications are as follows:Principal Property and Equipment ClassificationEstimated Useful LifeAircraft, engines and related rotable parts20\\xa0–\\xa030 yearsBuildings and improvements5\\xa0–\\xa030\\xa0yearsFurniture, fixtures and other equipment3\\xa0–\\xa010 yearsCapitalized software5\\xa0–\\xa010 yearsAmerican assesses impairment of operating property and equipment when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. An asset or group of assets is considered impaired when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets and the net book value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair value. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell.Total depreciation and amortization expense was $2.5 billion, $2.4 billion and $2.1 billion for the years ended December\\xa031, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.(g) LeasesAmerican determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets, current operating lease liabilities and noncurrent operating lease liabilities in American’s consolidated balance sheet. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, current maturities of long-term debt and finance leases and long-term debt and finance leases, net of current maturities, in American’s consolidated balance sheets.ROU assets represent American’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of lease payments over the lease term. 123NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC.American uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate, which is derived from information available at the lease commencement date, in determining the present value of lease payments. American gives consideration to its recent debt issuances as well as publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics when calculating its incremental borrowing rates.American’s lease term includes options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that it will exercise that option. Leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. American’s lease agreements do not contain any residual value guarantees.Under certain of American’s capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers, American does not own the underlying aircraft. However, since American controls the marketing, scheduling, ticketing, pricing and seat inventories of these aircraft and therefore control the asset, the aircraft is deemed to be leased for accounting purposes. For these capacity purchase agreements, American accounts for the lease and non-lease components separately. The lease component consists of the aircraft and the non-lease components consist of services, such as the crew and maintenance. American allocates the consideration in the capacity purchase agreements to the lease and non-lease components using their estimated relative standalone prices. See Note 10(b) for additional information on its capacity purchase agreements.For real estate, American accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.(h) Income TaxesIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded net as noncurrent deferred income taxes.American provides a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of its deferred tax assets, will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income. American considers all available positive and negative evidence and makes certain assumptions in evaluating the realizability of its deferred tax assets. Many factors are considered that impact American’s assessment of future profitability, including conditions which are beyond American’s control, such as the health of the economy, the availability and price volatility of aircraft fuel and travel demand.(i) GoodwillGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but assessed for impairment annually on October 1 or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. American has one consolidated reporting unit.Goodwill is assessed for impairment by initially performing a qualitative assessment and, if necessary, then comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is lower than its carrying value, an impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded. Based upon American’s annual assessment, there was no goodwill impairment in 2019. The carrying value of the goodwill on American’s consolidated balance sheets was $4.1 billion as of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018.(j) Other Intangibles, NetIntangible assets consist primarily of domestic airport slots, customer relationships, marketing agreements, international slots and route authorities, airport gate leasehold rights and tradenames.Definite-Lived Intangible AssetsDefinite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.124NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC.The following table provides information relating to American’s amortizable intangible assets as of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018 (in millions):\\xa0December\\xa031,\\xa02019\\xa02018Domestic airport slots$365\\xa0$365Customer relationships300\\xa0300Marketing agreements105\\xa0105Tradenames35\\xa035Airport gate leasehold rights137\\xa0137Accumulated amortization(704)\\xa0(663)Total$238\\xa0$279Certain domestic airport slots and airport gate leasehold rights are amortized on a straight-line basis over 25 years. The customer relationships and marketing agreements were identified as intangible assets subject to amortization and are amortized on a straight-line basis over approximately nine years and 30 years, respectively. Tradenames are fully amortized.American recorded amortization expense related to these intangible assets of $41 million for both years ended December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018 and $44 million for 2017. American expects to record annual amortization expense for these intangible assets as follows (in millions):2020$4120214120224120237202472025 and thereafter101Total$238Indefinite-Lived Intangible AssetsIndefinite-lived intangible assets include certain domestic airport slots and international slots and route authorities. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but instead are assessed for impairment annually on October 1 or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. As of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, American had $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of indefinite-lived intangible assets on its consolidated balance sheets.Indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment by initially performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether American believes it is more likely than not that an asset has been impaired. If American believes impairment has occurred, American then evaluates for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of assets to the carrying value. An impairment charge is recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value is less than its carrying value. Based upon American’s annual assessment, there were no material indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments in 2019.125NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC.(k) Revenue RecognitionRevenueThe following are the significant categories comprising American’s reported operating revenues (in millions):\\xa0Year Ended December\\xa031,\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017Passenger revenue:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Passenger travel$38,831\\xa0$37,457\\xa0$36,152Loyalty revenue - travel (1)3,179\\xa03,219\\xa02,979Total passenger revenue42,010\\xa040,676\\xa039,131Cargo863\\xa01,013\\xa0890Other:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Loyalty revenue - marketing services2,361\\xa02,352\\xa02,124Other revenue527\\xa0489\\xa0465Total other revenue2,888\\xa02,841\\xa02,589Total operating revenues$45,761\\xa0$44,530\\xa0$42,610\\xa0(1)\\xa0Loyalty revenue included in passenger revenue is principally comprised of mileage credit redemptions earned through travel or from co-branded credit card and other partners. See “Loyalty Revenue” below for further discussion on these mileage credits.The following is American’s total passenger revenue by geographic region (in millions):\\xa0Year Ended December\\xa031,\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017Domestic$30,881\\xa0$29,573\\xa0$28,749Latin America5,047\\xa05,125\\xa04,840Atlantic4,624\\xa04,376\\xa04,028Pacific1,458\\xa01,602\\xa01,514Total passenger revenue$42,010\\xa0$40,676\\xa0$39,131American attributes passenger revenue by geographic region based upon the origin and destination of each flight segment.Passenger RevenueAmerican recognizes all revenues generated from transportation on American and its regional flights operated under the brand name American Eagle, including associated baggage fees, ticketing change fees and other inflight services, as passenger revenue when transportation is provided. Ticket and other related sales for transportation that has not yet been provided are initially deferred and recorded as air traffic liability on American’s consolidated balance sheets. The air traffic liability principally represents tickets sold for future travel on American and partner airlines, as well as estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel. The majority of tickets sold are nonrefundable. A small percentage of tickets, some of which are partially used tickets, expire unused. Due to complex pricing structures, refund and exchange policies, and interline agreements with other airlines, certain amounts are recognized in passenger revenue using estimates regarding both the timing of the revenue recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized. These estimates are generally based on the analysis of American’s historical data. American has consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from unused tickets at the date of travel. Estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic liability are routinely evaluated based on subsequent activity to validate the accuracy of American’s estimates. Any adjustments resulting from periodic evaluations of the estimated air traffic liability are included in passenger revenue during the period in which the evaluations are completed. 126NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC.Various taxes and fees assessed on the sale of tickets to end customers are collected by American as an agent and remitted to taxing authorities. These taxes and fees have been presented on a net basis in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and recorded as a liability until remitted to the appropriate taxing authority.Loyalty RevenueAmerican currently operates the loyalty program, AAdvantage. This program awards mileage credits to passengers who fly on American, any oneworld airline or other partner airlines, or by using the services of other program participants, such as the Citi and Barclaycard US co-branded credit cards, and certain hotels and car rental companies. Mileage credits can be redeemed for travel on American and other participating partner airlines, as well as other non-air travel awards such as hotels and rental cars. For mileage credits earned by AAdvantage loyalty program members, American applies the deferred revenue method.Mileage credits earned through travelFor mileage credits earned through travel, American applies a relative selling price approach whereby the total amount collected from each passenger ticket sale is allocated between the air transportation and the mileage credits earned. The portion of each passenger ticket sale attributable to mileage credits earned is initially deferred and then recognized in passenger revenue when mileage credits are redeemed and transportation is provided. The estimated selling price of mileage credits is determined using an equivalent ticket value approach, which uses historical data, including award redemption patterns by geographic region and class of service, as well as similar fares as those used to settle award redemptions. The estimated selling price of miles is adjusted for an estimate of miles that will not be redeemed based on historical redemption patterns. Mileage credits sold to co-branded credit cards and other partners American sells mileage credits to participating airline partners and non-airline business partners, including American’s co-branded credit card partners, under contracts with terms extending generally for one to seven years. Consideration received from the sale of mileage credits is variable and payment terms typically are within 30 days subsequent to the month of mileage sale. Sales of mileage credits to non-airline business partners are comprised of two components, transportation and marketing. American allocates the consideration received from these sales of mileage credits based on the relative selling price of each product or service delivered.American’s most significant partner agreements are its co-branded credit card agreements with Citi and Barclaycard US that American entered into in 2016. American identified the following revenue elements in these co-branded credit card agreements: the transportation component; and the use of intellectual property, including the American brand and access to loyalty program member lists, which is the predominant element in the agreements, as well as advertising (collectively, the marketing component). Accordingly, American recognizes the marketing component in other revenue in the period of the mileage sale following the sales-based royalty method.The transportation component represents the estimated selling price of future travel awards and is determined using the same equivalent ticket value approach described above. The portion of each mileage credit sold attributable to transportation is initially deferred and then recognized in passenger revenue when mileage credits are redeemed and transportation is provided.For the portion of American’s outstanding mileage credits that it estimates will not be redeemed, American recognizes the associated value proportionally as the remaining mileage credits are redeemed. American’s estimates are based on analysis of historical redemptions.Cargo RevenueCargo revenue is recognized when American provides the transportation.Other RevenueOther revenue includes revenue associated with American’s loyalty program, which is comprised principally of the marketing component of mileage sales to co-branded credit card and other partners and other marketing related payments. Loyalty revenue included in other revenue was $2.4 billion for both years ended December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018 and $2.1 billion for 2017. The accounting and recognition for the loyalty program marketing services are discussed above in “Loyalty Revenue.” The remaining amounts included within other revenue relate to airport clubs, advertising and vacation-related services.127NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC. Contract BalancesAmerican’s significant contract liabilities are comprised of (1) outstanding loyalty program mileage credits that may be redeemed for future travel and other non-air travel awards, reported as loyalty program liability on American’s consolidated balance sheets and (2) ticket sales for transportation that has not yet been provided, reported as air traffic liability on American’s consolidated balance sheets.\\xa0December 31,\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa0(in millions)Loyalty program liability$8,615\\xa0$8,539Air traffic liability4,808\\xa04,339Total$13,423\\xa0$12,878The balance of the loyalty program liability fluctuates based on seasonal patterns, which impact the volume of mileage credits issued through travel or sold to co-branded credit card and other partners (deferral of revenue) and mileage credits redeemed (recognition of revenue).

Mileage credits are combined in one homogenous pool and are not separately identifiable. As such, the revenue is comprised of miles that were part of the loyalty program deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period, as well as miles that were issued during the period.(2)\\xa0Mileage credits can be redeemed at any time and do not expire as long as that AAdvantage member has any type of qualifying activity at least every 18 months. As of December\\xa031, 2019, American’s current loyalty program liability was $3.2 billion and represents American’s current estimate of revenue expected to be recognized in the next 12 months based on historical trends, with the balance reflected in long-term loyalty program liability expected to be recognized as revenue in periods thereafter.The air traffic liability principally represents tickets sold for future travel on American and partner airlines, as well as estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel. The balance in American’s air traffic liability also fluctuates with seasonal travel patterns. The contract duration of passenger tickets is one year. Accordingly, any revenue associated with tickets sold for future travel will be recognized within 12 months. For 2019, $3.3 billion of revenue was recognized in passenger revenue that was included in American’s air traffic liability at December\\xa031, 2018.With respect to contract receivables, reflected as accounts receivable, net on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, these primarily include receivables for tickets sold to individual passengers through the use of major credit cards. These receivables are short-term, mostly settled within seven days after sale. Bad debt losses, which have been minimal in the past, have been considered in establishing allowances for doubtful accounts.(l) Maintenance, Materials and RepairsMaintenance and repair costs for owned and leased flight equipment are charged to operating expense as incurred, except costs incurred for maintenance and repair under flight hour maintenance contract agreements, which are accrued based on contractual terms when an obligation exists.(m) Selling ExpensesSelling expenses include credit card fees, commissions, computerized reservations systems fees and advertising. Selling expenses associated with passenger revenue are expensed when the transportation or service is provided. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $129 million, $128 million and $135 million for the years ended December\\xa031, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.128NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC.(n) Share-based CompensationAmerican accounts for its share-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the stock award at the time of grant, which is recognized ratably over the vesting period of the stock award. The majority of American’s stock awards are time vested restricted stock units, and the fair value of such awards is based on the market price of the underlying shares of AAG common stock on the date of grant. See Note 13 for further discussion of share-based compensation.(o) Foreign Currency Gains and LossesForeign currency gains and losses are recorded as part of other income, net within total nonoperating expense, net in American’s consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December\\xa031, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, foreign currency losses were $32 million, $54 million and $4 million.(p) Other Operating ExpensesOther operating expenses includes costs associated with ground and cargo handling, crew travel, aircraft food and catering, passenger accommodation, airport security, international navigation fees and certain general and administrative expenses.(q) Regional ExpensesExpenses associated with American Eagle operations are classified as regional expenses on American’s consolidated statements of operations.

In addition, certain lenders party to the April 2016 Credit Agreement extended the maturity date of their commitments under the April 2016 Revolving Facility to October\\xa02024 from October 2023.December 2016 Credit FacilitiesIn December 2016, American and AAG entered into the Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement, dated as of December 15, 2016 (as amended, the December 2016 Credit Agreement; the term loan facility established thereunder, the December 2016 Term Loan Facility; and together with the revolving credit facility that may be established thereunder in the future, the December 2016 Credit Facilities).Certain details of American’s 2013 Credit Facilities, 2014 Credit Facilities, April 2016 Credit Facilities and December 2016 Credit Facilities (collectively referred to as the Credit Facilities) are shown in the table below as of December\\xa031, 2019:\\xa02013 Credit Facilities\\xa02014 Credit Facilities\\xa0April 2016 Credit Facilities\\xa0December 2016 Credit Facilities\\xa02013 Replacement Term Loan\\xa02013\\xa0Revolving Facility\\xa02014 TermLoan\\xa02014\\xa0Revolving Facility\\xa0April 2016Term Loan\\xa0April 2016Revolving Facility\\xa0December 2016 Term LoanAggregate principal issued\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0or credit facility availability\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(in millions)$1,919\\xa0$750\\xa0$1,250\\xa0$1,643\\xa0$1,000\\xa0$450\\xa0$1,250Principal outstanding or\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0drawn (in millions)$1,807\\xa0$—\\xa0$1,202\\xa0$—\\xa0$970\\xa0$—\\xa0$1,213Maturity dateJune 2025\\xa0October 2024\\xa0October 2021\\xa0October 2024\\xa0April 2023\\xa0October 2024\\xa0December 2023LIBOR margin1.75%\\xa02.00%\\xa02.00%\\xa02.00%\\xa02.00%\\xa02.00%\\xa02.00%The term loans under each of the Credit Facilities are repayable in annual installments in an amount equal to 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount issued, with any unpaid balance due on the respective maturity dates. Voluntary prepayments may be made by American at any time.132NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC.The 2013 Revolving Facility, 2014 Revolving Facility and April 2016 Revolving Facility provide that American may from time to time borrow, repay and reborrow loans thereunder. The 2013 Revolving Facility and 2014 Revolving Facility have the ability to issue letters of credit thereunder in an aggregate amount outstanding at any time up to $100 million and $200 million, respectively. The 2013 Revolving Facility, 2014 Revolving Facility and April 2016 Revolving Facility are each subject to an undrawn annual fee of 0.63%. As of December\\xa031, 2019, there were no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the 2013 Revolving Facility, 2014 Revolving Facility or April 2016 Revolving Facility. The December 2016 Credit Facilities provide for a revolving credit facility that may be established thereunder in the future.Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, the Credit Facilities are secured by collateral, including certain spare parts, slots, route authorities, simulators and leasehold rights. American has the ability to make future modifications to the collateral pledged, subject to certain restrictions. American’s obligations under the Credit Facilities are guaranteed by AAG. American is required to maintain a certain minimum ratio of appraised value of the collateral to the outstanding loans as further described below in “Collateral-Related Covenants.”The Credit Facilities contain events of default customary for similar financings, including cross default to other material indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the outstanding obligations may be accelerated and become due and payable immediately. In addition, if a “change of control” occurs, American will (absent an amendment or waiver) be required to repay at par the loans outstanding under the Credit Facilities and terminate the 2013 Revolving Facility, 2014 Revolving Facility and April 2016 Revolving Facility and any revolving credit facility established under the December 2016 Credit Facilities. The Credit Facilities also include covenants that, among other things, require AAG to maintain a minimum aggregate liquidity (as defined in the Credit Facilities) of not less than $2.0 billion and limit the ability of AAG and its restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends and make certain other payments, make certain investments, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens on the collateral, dispose of the collateral, enter into certain affiliate transactions and engage in certain business activities, in each case subject to certain exceptions.In December 2019, due to uncertainty surrounding the timing of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft return to service, American entered into an additional short-term revolving line of credit to provide us with incremental borrowing capacity of up to $400 million. We have no present intention to borrow any amounts under this facility, which matures in September 2020 with an optional extension to December 2020.(b) EETCs2019-1 Aircraft EETCs In August 2019, American created three pass-through trusts which issued approximately $1.1 billion aggregate face amount of Series 2019-1 Class AA, Class A and Class B EETCs (the 2019-1 Aircraft EETCs) in connection with the financing of 35 aircraft previously delivered or to be delivered to American through September 2020 (the 2019-1 Aircraft). As of December\\xa031, 2019, approximately $804 million of the proceeds had been used to purchase equipment notes issued by American in connection with financing 28 aircraft under the 2019-1 Aircraft EETCs, of which $608 million was used to repay existing indebtedness. Interest and principal payments on equipment notes issued in connection with the 2019-1 Aircraft EETCs are payable semi-annually in February and August of each year, with interest payments scheduled to begin in February 2020 and with principal payments scheduled to begin (i) in the case of equipment notes with respect to any 2019-1 Aircraft owned by American at the time of issuance of the 2019-1 Aircraft EETCs, in February 2020 and (ii) in the case of equipment notes with respect to the Embraer E175 aircraft and the Airbus A321neo aircraft scheduled to be delivered after the issuance of the 2019-1 Aircraft EETCs, in August 2020 and August 2021, respectively. The remaining proceeds of approximately $293 million as of December\\xa031, 2019 were being held in escrow with a depositary for the benefit of the holders of the 2019-1 Aircraft EETCs until such time as American issues additional equipment notes with respect to the remaining 2019-1 Aircraft to the pass-through trusts, which will purchase such additional equipment notes with the escrowed funds. These escrowed funds are not guaranteed by American and are not reported as debt on its condensed consolidated balance sheet because the proceeds held by the depositary for the benefit of the holders of the 2019-1 Aircraft EETCs are not American’s assets.133NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC.Certain information regarding the 2019-1 Aircraft EETC equipment notes and remaining escrowed proceeds, as of December\\xa031, 2019, is set forth in the table below.\\xa02019-1 Aircraft EETCs\\xa0Series AA\\xa0Series A\\xa0Series BAggregate principal issued$579 million\\xa0$289 million\\xa0$229 millionRemaining escrowed proceeds$155 million\\xa0$77 million\\xa0$61 millionFixed interest rate per annum3.15%\\xa03.50%\\xa03.85%Maturity dateFebruary 2032\\xa0February 2032\\xa0February 20282019-1 Engine EETCsIn June 2019, American created pass-through trusts which issued $650 million in aggregate face amount of 2019-1 Engine EETCs (the 2019-1 Engine EETCs), with maturities from June 2022 to June 2026. All of the proceeds received by such pass-through trusts from the sale of the 2019-1 Engine EETCs have been used to acquire equipment notes issued by American to the pass-through trusts. The pass-through trust certificates represent the right to payment under the equipment notes that are full-recourse obligations of American and such equipment notes are secured by spare aircraft engines currently owned and operated by American.(c) Equipment Loans and Other Notes Payable Issued in 2019 In 2019, American entered into agreements under which it borrowed $1.7 billion in connection with the financing or refinancing, as the case may be, of certain aircraft and other flight equipment, of which $643 million was used to repay existing indebtedness. Debt incurred under these agreements matures in 2023 through 2031 and bears interest at variable rates (comprised of LIBOR plus an applicable margin) averaging 3.37% at December\\xa031, 2019.GuaranteesAs of December\\xa031, 2019, American had issued guarantees covering AAG’s $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due March 2020 and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.000% senior notes due June 2022.Collateral-Related CovenantsCertain of American’s debt financing agreements (including its term loans, revolving credit facilities and spare engine EETCs) contain loan to value (LTV) ratio covenants and require American to appraise the related collateral annually. Pursuant to such agreements, if the LTV ratio exceeds a specified threshold or if the value of the appraised collateral fails to meet a specified threshold, as the case may be, American is required, as applicable, to pledge additional qualifying collateral (which in some cases may include cash or investment securities), or pay down such financing, in whole or in part.134NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC.Specifically, American is required to meet certain collateral coverage tests on an annual basis for its Credit Facilities, as described below:\\xa02013 Credit Facilities\\xa02014 Credit Facilities\\xa0April 2016 CreditFacilities\\xa0December 2016Credit FacilitiesFrequency of Appraisals of\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Appraised CollateralAnnual\\xa0Annual\\xa0Annual\\xa0AnnualLTV Requirement1.6x Collateral valuation to amount of debt outstanding (62.5% LTV)\\xa01.6x Collateral valuation to amount of debt outstanding (62.5% LTV)\\xa01.6x Collateral valuation to amount of debt outstanding (62.5% LTV)\\xa01.6x Collateral valuation to amount of debt outstanding (62.5% LTV)LTV as of Last Measurement\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Date36.2%\\xa017.7%\\xa036.2%\\xa053.6%Collateral DescriptionGenerally, certain slots, route authorities and airport gate leasehold rights used by American to operate all services between the U.S. and South America\\xa0Generally, certain slots, route authorities and airport gate leasehold rights used by American to operate certain services between the U.S. and European Union (including London Heathrow)\\xa0Generally, certain spare parts\\xa0Generally, certain Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) slots, certain La Guardia Airport (LGA) slots, certain simulators and certain leasehold rightsAt December\\xa031, 2019, American was in compliance with the applicable collateral coverage tests as of the most recent measurement dates.4.\\xa0\\xa0LeasesAmerican leases certain aircraft and engines, including aircraft under capacity purchase agreements. As of December\\xa031, 2019, American had 636 leased aircraft, with remaining terms ranging from less than one year to 12 years.At each airport where American conducts flight operations, American has agreements, generally with a governmental unit or authority, for the use of passenger, operations and baggage handling space as well as runways and taxiways. These agreements, particularly in the U.S., often contain provisions for periodic adjustments to rates and charges applicable under such agreements. These rates and charges also vary with American’s level of operations and the operations of the airport. Because of the variable nature of these rates, these leases are not recorded on American’s balance sheet as a ROU asset or a lease liability. Additionally, at American’s hub locations and in certain other cities it serves, American leases administrative offices, catering, cargo, training, maintenance and other facilities.The components of lease expense were as follows (in millions):\\xa0Year Ended December 31,\\xa020192018Operating lease cost$2,012\\xa0$1,889Finance lease cost:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Amortization of assets79\\xa078Interest on lease liabilities43\\xa048Variable lease cost2,542\\xa02,353Total net lease cost$4,676\\xa0$4,368Included in the table above is $236 million and $226 million of operating lease cost under American’s capacity purchase agreement with Republic for the years ended December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

provides a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets, which include the net operating losses (NOLs), when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of its deferred tax assets, will not be realized.\\xa0The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income.\\xa0American considers all available positive and negative evidence and makes certain assumptions in evaluating the realizability of its deferred tax assets.\\xa0Many factors are considered that impact American’s assessment of future profitability, including conditions which are beyond its control, such as the health of the economy, the availability and price volatility of aircraft fuel and travel demand.The components of American’s deferred tax assets and

2019, American had approximately $9.2 billion of federal NOLs carried over from prior taxable years (NOL Carryforwards) to reduce future federal taxable income, substantially all of which American expects to be available for use in 2020. American is a member of AAG’s consolidated federal and certain state income tax returns. The amount of federal NOL Carryforwards available in those returns is $9.1 billion, substantially all of which is expected to be available for use in 2020. The federal NOL Carryforwards will expire beginning in 2023 if unused. American also had approximately $2.9 billion of NOL Carryforwards to reduce future state taxable income at December\\xa031, 2019, which will expire in years 2020 through 2039 if unused. American’s ability to deduct its NOL Carryforwards and to utilize certain other available tax attributes can be substantially constrained under the general annual limitation rules of Section\\xa0382 where an “ownership change” has occurred. Substantially all of American’s remaining federal NOL Carryforwards attributable to US Airways Group are subject to limitation under Section\\xa0382; however, American’s ability to utilize such NOL Carryforwards is not anticipated to be effectively constrained as a result of such limitation. American elected to be covered by certain special rules for federal income tax purposes that permitted approximately $9.5 billion (with $7.2 billion of unlimited NOL still remaining at December\\xa031, 2019) of its federal NOL Carryforwards to be utilized without regard to the annual limitation generally imposed by Section\\xa0382. Similar limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. American’s ability to utilize any new NOL Carryforwards arising after the ownership changes is not affected by the annual limitation rules imposed by Section\\xa0382 unless another future ownership change occurs. Under the Section\\xa0382 limitation, cumulative stock ownership changes among material stockholders exceeding 50% during a rolling three-year period can potentially limit a company’s future use of NOLs and tax credits.At December\\xa031, 2019, American had an AMT credit carryforward of approximately $226 million available for federal income tax purposes, which is presently expected to be fully refundable over the next several years as a result of the repeal of corporate AMT as part of the 2017 Tax Act.138NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC.In 2019, American recorded an income tax provision of $633 million, with an effective rate of approximately 24%, which was substantially non-cash as American utilized its NOLs as described above.  Substantially all of American’s income before income taxes is attributable to the United States. American is part of the AAG consolidated income tax return. American files its tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. American’s 2016 through 2018 tax years are still subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. Various state and foreign jurisdiction tax years remain open to examination and American is under examination, in administrative appeals, or engaged in tax litigation in certain jurisdictions. American believes that the effect of any assessments will not be material to its consolidated financial statements.The amount of, and changes to, American’s uncertain tax positions were not material in any of the years presented. American accrues interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating expense, respectively.The 2017 Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017 and is the most comprehensive tax change in more than 30 years. American completed its evaluation of the 2017 Tax Act and American reflected the impact of its effects, including the impact of a lower corporate income tax rate (21% vs. 35%) on its deferred tax assets and liabilities and the one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred. For the year ended December 31 2017, American recognized a special income tax provision of $924 million to reflect these impacts of the 2017 Tax Act. 6.\\xa0\\xa0Risk ManagementAmerican’s economic prospects are heavily dependent upon two variables it cannot control: the health of the economy and the price of fuel.Due to the discretionary nature of business and leisure travel spending and the highly competitive nature of the airline industry, American’s revenues are heavily influenced by the condition of the U.S. economy and economies in other regions of the world. Unfavorable conditions in these broader economies have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased passenger demand for air travel, changes in booking practices and related reactions by American’s competitors, all of which in turn have had, and may have in the future, a negative effect on American’s business. In addition, during challenging economic times, actions by its competitors to increase their revenues can have an adverse impact on American’s revenues.American’s operating results are materially impacted by changes in the availability, price volatility and cost of aircraft fuel, which represents one of the largest single cost items in American’s business. Aircraft fuel prices have in the past, and may in the future, experience substantial volatility. Because of the amount of fuel needed to operate American’s business, even a relatively small increase or decrease in the price of aircraft fuel can have a material effect on American’s operating results and liquidity.These additional factors could impact American’s results of operations, financial performance and liquidity:(a) Credit RiskMost of American’s receivables relate to tickets sold to individual passengers through the use of major credit cards or to tickets sold by other airlines and used by passengers on American. These receivables are short-term, mostly settled within seven days after sale. Bad debt losses, which have been minimal in the past, have been considered in establishing allowances for doubtful accounts. American does not believe it is subject to any significant concentration of credit risk.(b) Interest Rate RiskAmerican has exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to its variable-rate debt obligations. Interest rates on $9.6 billion principal amount of long-term debt as of December\\xa031, 2019 are subject to adjustment to reflect changes in floating interest rates. The weighted average effective interest rate on American’s variable-rate debt was 3.6% at December\\xa031, 2019. American currently does not have an interest rate hedge program to hedge its exposure to floating interest rates on its variable-rate debt obligations.(c) Foreign Currency RiskAmerican is exposed to the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency-denominated transactions. American’s largest exposure comes from the British pound, Euro, Canadian dollar and various Latin American currencies, primarily the Brazilian real. American does not currently have a foreign currency hedge program.139NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC.7.\\xa0\\xa0Fair Value Measurements and Other InvestmentsAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisFair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e. an exit price) on the measurement date in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability. Accounting standards include disclosure requirements around fair values used for certain financial instruments and establish a fair value hierarchy. The hierarchy prioritizes valuation inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Each fair value measurement is reported in one of three levels:•Level 1\\xa0–\\xa0Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;•Level 2\\xa0–\\xa0Inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and•Level 3\\xa0–\\xa0Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.When available, American uses quoted market prices to determine the fair value of its financial assets. If quoted market prices are not available, American measures fair value using valuation techniques that use, when possible, current market-based or independently-sourced market parameters, such as interest rates and currency rates.American utilizes the market approach to measure the fair value of its financial assets. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets.

The defined benefit pension plans provide benefits for participating employees based on years of service and average compensation for a specified period of time before retirement. Effective November\\xa01, 2012, substantially all of American’s defined benefit pension plans were frozen and American began providing enhanced benefits under its defined contribution pension plans for certain employee groups. American uses a December\\xa031 measurement date for all of its defined benefit pension plans. American also provides certain retiree medical and other postretirement benefits, including health care and life insurance benefits, to retired employees. Effective November\\xa01, 2012, American modified its retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans to eliminate the company subsidy for employees who retire on or after November\\xa01, 2012. As a result of modifications to its retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans in 2012, American recognized a negative plan amendment of $1.9 billion, which is included as a component of prior service benefit in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) and will be amortized over the future service life of the active plan participants for whom the benefit was eliminated, or approximately eight years. As of December\\xa031, 2019, $150 million of prior service benefit remains, which will be fully amortized in 2020.  141NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC.Benefit Obligations, Fair Value of Plan Assets and Funded StatusThe following tables provide a reconciliation of the changes in the pension and retiree medical and other postretirement benefits obligations, fair value of plan assets and a statement of funded status as of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018:\\xa0Pension Benefits\\xa0Retiree\\xa0Medical\\xa0andOther Postretirement\\xa0Benefits\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(In millions)Benefit obligation at beginning of period$16,282\\xa0$18,175\\xa0$837\\xa0$1,010Service cost2\\xa02\\xa03\\xa05Interest cost699\\xa0670\\xa033\\xa035Actuarial (gain) loss (1), (2)1,951\\xa0(1,905)\\xa020\\xa0(132)Settlements(2)\\xa0(4)\\xa0—\\xa0—Benefit payments(686)\\xa0(659)\\xa0(74)\\xa0(81)Other—\\xa03\\xa05\\xa0—Benefit obligation at end of period$18,246\\xa0$16,282\\xa0$824\\xa0$837\\xa0Pension Benefits\\xa0Retiree\\xa0Medical\\xa0andOther Postretirement\\xa0Benefits\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(In millions)Fair value of plan assets at beginning of period$10,001\\xa0$11,340\\xa0$225\\xa0$295Actual return (loss) on plan assets2,292\\xa0(1,148)\\xa041\\xa0(24)Employer contributions (3)1,224\\xa0472\\xa012\\xa035Settlements(2)\\xa0(4)\\xa0—\\xa0—Benefit payments(686)\\xa0(659)\\xa0(74)\\xa0(81)Fair value of plan assets at end of period$12,829\\xa0$10,001\\xa0$204\\xa0$225Funded status at end of period$(5,417)\\xa0$(6,281)\\xa0$(620)\\xa0$(612)\\xa0(1)\\xa0The 2019 and 2018 pension actuarial (gain) loss primarily relates to changes in American’s weighted average discount rate and mortality assumption and, in 2018, changes to American’s retirement rate assumptions.(2)\\xa0The 2019 retiree medical and other postretirement benefits actuarial loss primarily relates to changes in American’s weighted average discount rate assumption and plan experience adjustments.The 2018 retiree medical and other postretirement benefits actuarial gain primarily relates to changes in American’s weighted average discount rate, medical trend and per capita claims assumptions.(3)\\xa0During 2019, American contributed $1.2 billion to its defined benefit pension plans, including supplemental contributions of $444 million and a $780 million minimum required contribution.

Expected returns on long duration bonds are based on yields to maturity of the bonds held at year-end. Expected returns on other assets are based on a combination of long-term historical returns, actual returns on plan assets achieved over the last ten years, current and expected market conditions, and expected value to be generated through active management and securities lending programs.A one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following approximate effects on American’s retiree medical and other postretirement benefits plans (in millions):\\xa01%\\xa0Increase\\xa01%\\xa0DecreaseIncrease (decrease) on 2019 service and interest cost$1\\xa0$(1)Increase (decrease) on benefit obligation as of December\\xa031, 201940\\xa0(40)Minimum ContributionsAmerican is required to make minimum contributions to its defined benefit pension plans under the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and various other laws for U.S. based plans as well as underfunding rules specific to countries where American maintains defined benefit plans. Based on current funding assumptions, American has minimum required contributions of $193 million for 2020. American’s funding obligations will depend on the performance of American’s investments held in trust by the pension plans, interest rates for determining liabilities, the amount of and timing of any supplemental contributions and American’s actuarial experience.Benefit PaymentsThe following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service as appropriate, are expected to be paid (approximately, in millions):\\xa02020\\xa02021\\xa02022\\xa02023\\xa02024\\xa02025-2029Pension benefits$749\\xa0$788\\xa0$827\\xa0$869\\xa0$910\\xa0$5,017Retiree medical and other postretirement benefits80\\xa071\\xa066\\xa064\\xa061\\xa0265144NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC.Plan AssetsThe objectives of American’s investment policies are to: maintain sufficient income and liquidity to pay retirement benefits; produce a long-term rate of return that meets or exceeds the assumed rate of return for plan assets; limit the volatility of asset performance and funded status; and diversify assets among asset classes and investment managers.Based on these investment objectives, a long-term strategic asset allocation has been established. This strategic allocation seeks to balance the potential benefit of improving the funded position with the potential risk that the funded position would decline. The current strategic target asset allocation is as follows:Asset Class/Sub-ClassAllowed\\xa0RangeEquity45%\\xa0-\\xa080%Public:\\xa0U.S. Large15%\\xa0-\\xa040%U.S. Small/Mid2%\\xa0-\\xa010%International10%\\xa0-\\xa025%Emerging Markets2%\\xa0-\\xa015%Alternative Investments5%\\xa0-\\xa030%Fixed Income20%\\xa0-\\xa055%Public:\\xa0U.S. Long Duration15%\\xa0-\\xa045%High Yield and Emerging Markets0%\\xa0-\\xa010%Private Income0%\\xa0-\\xa010%Other0%\\xa0-\\xa05%Cash Equivalents0%\\xa0-\\xa020%Public equity as well as high yield and emerging market fixed income securities are used to provide diversification and are expected to generate higher returns over the long-term than U.S. long duration bonds. Public stocks are managed using a value investment approach in order to participate in the returns generated by stocks in the long-term, while reducing year-over-year volatility. U.S. long duration bonds are used to partially hedge the assets from declines in interest rates. Alternative (private) investments are used to provide expected returns in excess of the public markets over the long-term. The pension plan’s master trust also participates in securities lending programs to generate additional income by loaning plan assets to borrowers on a fully collateralized basis. These programs are subject to market risk.Investments in securities traded on recognized securities exchanges are valued at the last reported sales price on the last business day of the year. Securities traded in the over-the-counter market are valued at the last bid price. The money market fund is valued at fair value which represents the net asset value of the shares of such fund as of the close of business at the end of the period. Investments in limited partnerships are carried at estimated net asset value as determined by and reported by the general partners of the partnerships and represent the proportionate share of the estimated fair value of the underlying assets of the limited partnerships. Common/collective trusts are valued at net asset value based on the fair values of the underlying investments of the trusts as determined by the sponsor of the trusts. The pension plan’s master trust also invests in a 103-12 investment entity (the 103-12 Investment Trust) which is designed to invest plan assets of more than one unrelated employer. The 103-12 Investment Trust is valued at net asset value which is determined by the issuer daily and is based on the aggregate fair value of trust assets less liabilities, divided by the number of units outstanding. No changes in valuation techniques or inputs occurred during the year.145NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC.Benefit Plan Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisThe fair value of American’s pension plan assets at December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, by asset category, were as follows (in millions):\\xa0Fair Value Measurements as of December\\xa031, 2019Asset CategoryQuoted\\xa0Prices\\xa0in Active\\xa0Markets\\xa0for Identical Assets(Level 1)\\xa0SignificantObservableInputs(Level 2)\\xa0SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3)\\xa0TotalCash and cash equivalents$20\\xa0$—\\xa0$—\\xa0$20Equity securities:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0International markets (a), (b)2,769\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa02,769Large-cap companies (b)2,312\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa02,312Mid-cap companies (b)543\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0543Small-cap companies (b)97\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa097Fixed income:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Corporate debt (c)—\\xa02,804\\xa0—\\xa02,804Government securities (d)—\\xa0923\\xa0—\\xa0923U.S. municipal securities—\\xa051\\xa0—\\xa051Mortgage backed securities—\\xa04\\xa0—\\xa04Alternative instruments:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Private market partnerships (e)—\\xa0—\\xa010\\xa010Private market partnerships measured at net asset value (e), (f)—\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa01,464Common/collective trusts (g)—\\xa0358\\xa0—\\xa0358Common/collective trusts and 103-12 Investment Trust measured at net asset value (f), (g)—\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa01,423Insurance group annuity contracts—\\xa0—\\xa02\\xa02Dividend and interest receivable53\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa053Due to/from brokers for sale of securities\\xa0–\\xa0net(4)\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0(4)Total$5,790\\xa0$4,140\\xa0$12\\xa0$12,829\\xa0(a)\\xa0Holdings are diversified as follows: 14% United Kingdom, 8% Switzerland, 8% Ireland, 7% Japan, 7% France, 6% South Korea, 6% Canada, 18% emerging markets and the remaining 26% with no concentration greater than 5% in any one country.(b)\\xa0There are no significant concentrations of holdings by company or industry.(c)\\xa0Includes approximately 76% investments in corporate debt with a S&P rating lower than A and 24% investments in corporate debt with a S&P rating A or higher.

American’s contributions to the IAM Pension Fund were $32 million, $31 million and $31 million for the years ended December\\xa031, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The IAM Pension Fund reported $467 million in employers’ contributions for the year ended December\\xa031, 2018, which is the most recent year for which such information is available. For 2018, American’s contributions represented more than 5% of total contributions to the IAM Pension Fund.On March 29, 2019, the actuary for the IAM Pension Fund certified that the fund was in endangered status despite reporting a funded status of over 80%. Additionally, the IAM Pension Fund’s Board voluntarily elected to enter into critical status on April 17, 2019. In connection with the entry into critical status, the IAM Pension Fund adopted a rehabilitation plan on April 17, 2019 (the Rehabilitation Plan). Under the Rehabilitation Plan, American was subject to an immaterial contribution surcharge, which ceased to apply June 14, 2019 upon American’s adoption of a contribution schedule under the Rehabilitation Plan. The contribution schedule American adopted provides for 2.5% annual increases to its contribution rate. This contribution schedule will remain in effect through the earlier of December 31, 2031 or the date the IAM Pension Fund emerges from critical status.Profit Sharing ProgramAmerican accrues 5% of its pre-tax income excluding net special items for its profit sharing program. For the year ended December\\xa031, 2019, American accrued $213 million for this program, which will be distributed to employees in the first quarter of 2020.149NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC.9.\\xa0\\xa0Accumulated Other Comprehensive LossThe components of AOCI are as follows (in millions):\\xa0Pension,RetireeMedical andOtherPostretirementBenefits\\xa0Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments\\xa0Income Tax Benefit(Provision)\\xa0(1)\\xa0TotalBalance at December\\xa031, 2017$(4,508)\\xa0$(1)\\xa0$(1,364)\\xa0$(5,873)Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications(61)\\xa0(4)\\xa015\\xa0(50)Amounts reclassified from AOCI(89)\\xa0—\\xa020(2)\\xa0(69)Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss)(150)\\xa0(4)\\xa035\\xa0(119)Balance at December\\xa031, 2018(4,658)\\xa0(5)\\xa0(1,329)\\xa0(5,992)Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications(471)\\xa03\\xa0106\\xa0(362)Amounts reclassified from AOCI(89)\\xa0—\\xa020(2)\\xa0(69)Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss)(560)\\xa03\\xa0126\\xa0(431)Balance at December\\xa031, 2019$(5,218)\\xa0$(2)\\xa0$(1,203)\\xa0$(6,423)\\xa0(1)\\xa0Relates principally to pension, retiree medical and other postretirement benefits obligations that will not be recognized in net income until the obligations are fully extinguished.(2)\\xa0Relates to pension, retiree medical and other postretirement benefits obligations and is recognized within the income tax provision on American’s consolidated statements of operations.Reclassifications out of AOCI for the years ended December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018 are as follows (in millions):\\xa0Amounts\\xa0reclassified\\xa0from\\xa0AOCI\\xa0Affected line items on theconsolidated\\xa0statements\\xa0ofoperations\\xa0Year Ended December\\xa031,\\xa0AOCI Components2019\\xa02018\\xa0Amortization of pension, retiree medical and other postretirement benefits:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Prior service benefit$(162)\\xa0$(161)\\xa0Nonoperating other income, netActuarial loss93\\xa092\\xa0Nonoperating other income, netTotal reclassifications for the period, net of tax$(69)\\xa0$(69)\\xa0\\xa0Amounts allocated to other comprehensive income for income taxes as further described in Note 5 will remain in AOCI until American ceases all related activities, such as termination of the pension plan.10.\\xa0\\xa0Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees(a) Aircraft, Engine and Other Purchase CommitmentsUnder all of American’s aircraft and engine purchase agreements, its total future commitments as of December\\xa031, 2019 are expected to be as follows (approximately, in millions):\\xa02020\\xa02021\\xa02022\\xa02023\\xa02024\\xa02025 and Thereafter\\xa0TotalPayments for aircraft commitments and certain engines (1)$1,629\\xa0$750\\xa0$1,599\\xa0$1,543\\xa0$2,574\\xa0$4,855\\xa0$12,950\\xa0(1)\\xa0These amounts are net of purchase deposits currently held by the manufacturers. American has granted a security interest in certain of its purchase deposits with Boeing. American’s purchase deposits held by all manufacturers totaled $1.7 billion as of December\\xa031, 2019.150NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC.On March 13, 2019, a directive from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded all U.S.-registered Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. American currently has 76 Boeing 737 MAX Family aircraft on order and American has not taken delivery of any Boeing 737 MAX Family aircraft since the grounding. The extent of the delay to the scheduled deliveries of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft is expected to be impacted by the length of time the FAA order remains in place, Boeing's production rate and the pace at which Boeing can deliver aircraft following the lifting of the FAA order, among other factors. Due to uncertainty surrounding the timing of delivery of certain aircraft, the amounts in the table represent American’s current best estimate, including with respect to the delivery of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft; however, the actual delivery schedule may differ from the table above, potentially materially.The amounts in the table exclude 22 787-8 aircraft to be delivered in 2020 and 2021 for which Boeing has committed to provide sale-leaseback financing (in the form of operating leases). See Note 4 for information regarding this operating lease commitment.Additionally, American has purchase commitments related to aircraft fuel, construction projects and information technology support as follows (approximately): $3.5 billion in 2020, $3.5 billion in 2021, $1.3 billion in 2022, $130 million in 2023, $81 million in 2024 and $77 million in 2025 and thereafter.(b) Capacity Purchase Agreements with Third-Party Regional CarriersAmerican has capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers. The capacity purchase agreements provide that all revenues, including passenger, in-flight, ancillary, mail and freight revenues, go to American. American controls marketing, scheduling, ticketing, pricing and seat inventories. In return, American agrees to pay predetermined fees to these airlines for operating an agreed-upon number of aircraft, without regard to the number of passengers on board. In addition, these agreements provide that American either reimburses or pays 100% of certain variable costs, such as airport landing fees, fuel and passenger liability insurance. As of December\\xa031, 2019, American’s capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers had expiration dates ranging from 2020 to 2032, with rights of American to extend the respective terms of certain agreements.As of December\\xa031, 2019, American’s minimum obligations under its capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers are as follows (approximately, in millions):\\xa02020\\xa02021\\xa02022\\xa02023\\xa02024\\xa02025 and Thereafter\\xa0TotalMinimum obligations under capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers (1)$1,115\\xa0$1,185\\xa0$1,126\\xa0$1,077\\xa0$1,077\\xa0$3,402\\xa0$8,982\\xa0(1)\\xa0Represents minimum payments under capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers, which are estimates of costs based on assumed minimum levels of flying under the capacity purchase agreements and American’s actual payments could differ materially. Excludes payments for the lease of certain aircraft under capacity purchase agreements, which are reflected in the operating lease obligations in Note 4. (c) Airport RedevelopmentLos Angeles International Airport (LAX)In 2018, American executed a lease agreement with Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA), which owns and operates LAX, in connection with a $1.6 billion modernization project related to LAX Terminals 4 and 5. Construction will occur in a phased approach, which started in October 2018 and is expected to be completed in 2028. The modernization project will include a unified departure hall to combine the entranceway of Terminals 4 and 5, reconfigured ticket counter and check-in areas with seamless access to security screening areas, 16 security screening lanes with automated technology and upgraded amenities at gate areas. The project will also include renovated break rooms, multi-use meeting rooms and team gathering spaces throughout the terminals to support American’s team members at LAX.American is managing this project and has legal title to the assets during their construction. As each phase is completed, the assets will be sold and transferred to LAWA, including the site improvements and non-proprietary improvements. As American controls the assets during construction, they are recognized on its balance sheet until legal title has transferred. For 2019, American incurred approximately $98 million in costs relating to the LAX modernization project, which are included within operating property and equipment on its consolidated balance sheet as of December\\xa031, 2019.151NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC.(d) Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAircraft and EnginesAmerican currently operates 382 owned aircraft and 69 leased aircraft, and owns 79 spare aircraft engines, which in each case were financed with EETCs issued by pass-through trusts. These trusts are off-balance sheet entities, the primary purpose of which is to finance the acquisition of flight equipment or to permit issuance of debt backed by existing flight equipment. In the case of aircraft EETCs, rather than finance each aircraft separately when such aircraft is purchased, delivered or refinanced, these trusts allow American to raise the financing for a number of aircraft at one time and, if applicable, place such funds in escrow pending a future purchase, delivery or refinancing of the relevant aircraft. Similarly, in the case of the spare engine EETCs, the trust allows American to use its existing pool of spare engines to raise financing under a single facility. The trusts have also been structured to provide for certain credit enhancements, such as liquidity facilities to cover certain interest payments, that reduce the risks to the purchasers of the trust certificates and, as a result, reduce the cost of aircraft financing to American.Each trust covers a set number of aircraft or spare engines scheduled to be delivered, financed or refinanced upon the issuance of the EETC or within a specific period of time thereafter. At the time of each covered aircraft or spare engine financing, the relevant trust used the proceeds of the issuance of the EETC (which may have been available at the time of issuance thereof or held in escrow until financing of the applicable aircraft following its delivery) to purchase equipment notes relating to the financed aircraft or engines. The equipment notes are issued, at American’s election, in connection with a mortgage financing of the aircraft or spare engines or, in certain cases, by a separate owner trust in connection with a leveraged lease financing of the aircraft. In the case of a leveraged lease financing, the owner trust then leases the aircraft to American. In both cases, the equipment notes are secured by a security interest in the aircraft or engines, as applicable. The pass-through trust certificates are not direct obligations of, nor are they guaranteed by, AAG or American. However, in the case of mortgage financings, the equipment notes issued to the trusts are direct obligations of American and, in certain instances, have been guaranteed by AAG. As of December\\xa031, 2019, $11.9 billion associated with these mortgage financings is reflected as debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.With respect to leveraged leases, American evaluated whether the leases had characteristics of a variable interest entity. American concluded the leasing entities met the criteria for variable interest entities; however, American concluded it is not the primary beneficiary under these leasing arrangements and accounts for the majority of its EETC leveraged lease financings as operating leases. American’s total future payments to the trusts of each of the relevant EETCs under these leveraged lease financings are $177 million as of December\\xa031, 2019, which are reflected in the operating lease obligations in Note 4. Letters of Credit and OtherAmerican provides financial assurance, such as letters of credit, surety bonds or restricted cash and investments, primarily to support projected workers’ compensation obligations and airport commitments. As of December\\xa031, 2019, American had $572 million of letters of credit and surety bonds securing various obligations. The letters of credit and surety bonds that are subject to expiration will expire on various dates through 2022.(e) Legal ProceedingsChapter 11 Cases. On November\\xa029, 2011, AMR, American, and certain of AMR’s other direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries (the Debtors) filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). On October\\xa021, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving and confirming the Debtors’ fourth amended joint plan of reorganization (as amended, the Plan). On the Effective Date, December\\xa09, 2013, the Debtors consummated their reorganization pursuant to the Plan and completed the Merger.Pursuant to rulings of the Bankruptcy Court, the Plan established the Disputed Claims Reserve to hold shares of AAG common stock reserved for issuance to disputed claimholders at the Effective Date that ultimately become holders of allowed claims. The shares of AAG common stock issued to the Disputed Claims Reserve were originally issued on December\\xa013, 2013 and have at all times since been included in the number of shares issued and outstanding as reported by AAG from time to time in its quarterly and annual reports, including for purposes of calculating earnings per common share. As disputed claims are resolved, the claimants receive distributions of shares from the Disputed Claims Reserve. However, American is not required to distribute additional shares above the limits contemplated by the Plan, even if the shares remaining for distribution in the Disputed Claims Reserve are not sufficient to fully pay any additional allowed unsecured claims. To the extent that any of the reserved shares remain undistributed upon resolution of all remaining disputed claims, such shares will not be returned to AAG but rather will be distributed to former AMR stockholders and former convertible noteholders 152NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC.treated as stockholders under the Plan. As of December\\xa031, 2019, the Disputed Claims Reserve held approximately 7 million shares of AAG common stock.Private Party Antitrust Action Related to Passenger Capacity. American, along with Delta Air Lines, Inc., Southwest Airlines Co., United Airlines, Inc. and, in the case of litigation filed in Canada, Air Canada, were named as defendants in approximately 100 putative class action lawsuits alleging unlawful agreements with respect to air passenger capacity. The U.S. lawsuits were consolidated in the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia (the DC Court). On June 15, 2018, American reached a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs in the amount of $45 million to resolve all class claims in the U.S. lawsuits. That settlement was approved by the DC Court on May 13, 2019. Three parties who objected to the settlement have appealed that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. American believes these appeals are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them. Private Party Antitrust Action Related to the Merger. On August\\xa06, 2013, a lawsuit captioned Carolyn Fjord, et al., v. AMR Corporation, et al., was filed in the Bankruptcy Court. The complaint named as defendants US Airways Group, US Airways, AMR and American, alleged that the effect of the Merger may be to create a monopoly in violation of Section\\xa07 of the Clayton Antitrust Act, and sought injunctive relief and/or divestiture. On November\\xa027, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court denied plaintiffs’ motion to preliminarily enjoin the Merger. On August 29, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court denied in part defendants' motion for summary judgment, and fully denied plaintiffs' cross-motion for summary judgment. The parties' evidentiary cases were presented before the Bankruptcy Court in a bench trial in March 2019. The parties submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law and made closing arguments in April 2019, and they are awaiting the Bankruptcy Court's decision. American believes this lawsuit is without merit and intends to vigorously defend against the allegations.Pension Benefits Action. On December 11, 2018, a lawsuit captioned Torres, et al. v. American Airlines, Inc., The Employee Benefits Committee and John/Jane Does 1-5, was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas.  The plaintiffs in this lawsuit purport to represent a class consisting of all participants in and beneficiaries under any of the four American defined benefit pension plans who elected to receive an optional form of benefit other than a lump sum distribution of a participant’s vested benefit. Under ERISA, participants covered by defined benefit plans accrue retirement benefits in the form of a single life annuity payable upon retirement on a monthly basis until the employee’s death, and may elect certain alternative forms of benefit payments. Plaintiffs contend that the mortality tables used by American for purposes of calculations related to these alternative forms of benefits are outdated and that more recent mortality tables would have provided more generous benefits and should have been used to make those calculations. The court has denied American’s motion to dismiss the complaint. American believes this lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend against the allegations.General. In addition to the specifically identified legal proceedings, American and its subsidiaries are also engaged in other legal proceedings from time to time.\\xa0Legal proceedings can be complex and take many months, or even years, to reach resolution, with the final outcome depending on a number of variables, some of which are not within American’s control. Therefore, although American will vigorously defend itself in each of the actions described above and such other legal proceedings, their ultimate resolution and potential financial and other impacts on American are uncertain but could be material.(f) Guarantees and IndemnificationsAmerican is a party to many routine contracts in which it provides general indemnities in the normal course of business to third parties for various risks. American is not able to estimate the potential amount of any liability resulting from the indemnities. These indemnities are discussed in the following paragraphs.In its aircraft financing agreements, American generally indemnifies the financing parties, trustees acting on their behalf and other relevant parties against liabilities (including certain taxes) resulting from the financing, manufacture, design, ownership, operation and maintenance of the aircraft regardless of whether these liabilities (including certain taxes) relate to the negligence of the indemnified parties.American’s loan agreements and other LIBOR-based financing transactions (including certain leveraged aircraft leases) generally obligate American to reimburse the applicable lender for incremental costs due to a change in law that imposes (i)\\xa0any reserve or special deposit requirement against assets of, deposits with or credit extended by such lender related to the loan, (ii)\\xa0any tax, duty or other charge with respect to the loan (except standard income tax) or (iii)\\xa0capital adequacy requirements. In addition, American’s loan agreements and other financing arrangements typically contain a withholding tax provision that requires American to pay additional amounts to the applicable lender or other financing party, generally if withholding taxes are imposed on such lender or other financing party as a result of a change in the applicable tax law.153NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC.In certain transactions, including certain aircraft financing leases and loans, the lessors, lenders and/or other parties have rights to terminate the transaction based on changes in foreign tax law, illegality or certain other events or circumstances. In such a case, American may be required to make a lump sum payment to terminate the relevant transaction.American has general indemnity clauses in many of its airport and other real estate leases where American as lessee indemnifies the lessor (and related parties) against liabilities related to American’s use of the leased property. Generally, these indemnifications cover liabilities resulting from the negligence of the indemnified parties, but not liabilities resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the indemnified parties. In addition, American provides environmental indemnities in many of these leases for contamination related to American’s use of the leased property.Under certain contracts with third parties, American indemnifies the third-party against legal liability arising out of an action by the third-party, or certain other parties. The terms of these contracts vary and the potential exposure under these indemnities cannot be determined. American has liability insurance protecting American for some of the obligations it has undertaken under these indemnities.American is required to make principal and interest payments for certain special facility revenue bonds issued by municipalities primarily to build or improve airport facilities and purchase equipment, which are leased to American. The payment of principal and interest of certain special facility revenue bonds is guaranteed by American. As of December\\xa031, 2019, the remaining lease payments through 2035 guaranteeing the principal and interest on these bonds are $589 million and the current carrying amount of the associated operating lease liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet is $321 million.As of December\\xa031, 2019, American had issued guarantees covering AAG’s $500 million aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due March 2020 and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.000% senior notes due June 2022.(g) Credit Card Processing AgreementsAmerican has agreements with companies that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services. American’s agreements allow these credit card processing companies, under certain conditions, to hold an amount of its cash (referred to as a holdback) equal to a portion of advance ticket sales that have been processed by that company, but for which American has not yet provided the air transportation. Additional holdback requirements in the event of material adverse changes in American’s financial condition will reduce its liquidity in the form of unrestricted cash by the amount of the holdbacks. These credit card processing companies are not currently entitled to maintain any holdbacks pursuant to these requirements.(h) Labor NegotiationsAs of December\\xa031, 2019, American employed approximately 104,200 active full-time equivalent employees. Approximately 84% of employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) with various labor unions and approximately 25% of employees are covered by CBAs that will become amendable within one year. Agreements in principle were reached on January 30, 2020 for joint collective bargaining agreements (JCBAs) covering American’s maintenance, fleet service, stock clerks, maintenance control technicians and maintenance training instructors. Those agreements are subject to membership ratification vote. Additionally, the post-Merger JCBAs covering American’s pilots and flight attendants became amendable in January 2020 and December 2019, respectively. Negotiations continue for new agreements.11.\\xa0\\xa0Supplemental Cash Flow InformationSupplemental disclosure of cash flow information and non-cash investing and financing activities are as follows (in millions):\\xa0Year\\xa0Ended\\xa0December\\xa031,\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017Non-cash investing and financing activities:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Settlement of bankruptcy obligations$7\\xa0$—\\xa0$15Equity Investment—\\xa0—\\xa0120Supplemental information:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Interest paid, net1,025\\xa01,009\\xa0942Income taxes paid8\\xa016\\xa018154NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC.12.\\xa0\\xa0Operating Segments and Related DisclosuresAmerican is managed as a single business unit that provides air transportation for passengers and cargo. This allows it to benefit from an integrated revenue pricing and route network that includes American and AAG’s wholly-owned and third-party regional carriers that fly under capacity purchase agreements operating as American Eagle. The flight equipment of all these carriers is combined to form one fleet that is deployed through a single route scheduling system. Financial information and annual operational plans and forecasts are prepared and reviewed by the chief operating decision maker at the consolidated level. When making operational decisions, the chief operating decision maker evaluates flight profitability data, which considers aircraft type and route economics, but is indifferent to the results of the individual regional carriers. The objective in making operational decisions is to maximize consolidated financial results, not the individual results of American or American Eagle.See Note 1(k) for American’s passenger revenue by geographic region. American’s tangible assets consist primarily of flight equipment, which are mobile across geographic markets and, therefore, have not been allocated. 13.\\xa0\\xa0Share-based CompensationThe 2013 AAG Incentive Award Plan (the 2013 Plan) provides that awards may be in the form of an option, restricted stock award, restricted stock unit award, performance award, dividend equivalent award, deferred stock award, deferred stock unit award, stock payment award or stock appreciation right. The 2013 Plan initially authorized the grant of awards for the issuance of up to 40 million shares. Any shares underlying awards granted under the 2013 Plan that are forfeited, terminate or are settled in cash (in whole or in part) without the delivery of shares will again be available for grant.American’s salaries, wages and benefits expense for the years ended December\\xa031, 2019, 2018 and 2017 included $95 million, $88 million and $90 million, respectively, of share-based compensation costs. During 2019, 2018 and 2017, AAG withheld approximately 0.8 million, 0.8 million and 1.1 million shares of AAG common stock, respectively, and paid approximately $25 million, $37 million and $51 million, respectively, in satisfaction of certain tax withholding obligations associated with employee equity awards.Restricted Stock Unit Awards (RSUs)The majority of American’s RSUs have service conditions (time vested primarily over three years). The grant-date fair value of these RSUs is equal to the market price of the underlying shares of AAG common stock on the date of grant. The expense for these RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for the entire award.

This term refers to the controls and procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC’s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. An evaluation of the effectiveness of AAG’s and American’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December\\xa031, 2019 was performed under the supervision and with the participation of AAG’s and American’s management, including AAG’s and American’s CEO and CFO. Based on that evaluation, AAG’s and American’s management, including AAG’s and American’s CEO and CFO, concluded that AAG’s and American’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December\\xa031, 2019 at the reasonable assurance level.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingOn December\\xa09, 2013, AAG acquired US Airways Group and its subsidiaries. We are still in the process of integrating certain processes, technology and operations for the post-Merger combined company, and we will continue to evaluate the impact of any related changes to our internal control over financial reporting. For the three months ended December\\xa031, 2019, there have been no changes in AAG’s or American’s internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, AAG’s and American’s internal control over financial reporting.Limitation on the Effectiveness of ControlsWe believe that a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and, as noted above, the CEO and CFO of AAG and American believe that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December\\xa031, 2019.Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingManagement of AAG and American is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. AAG’s and American’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. AAG’s and American’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that:•pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of AAG or American, respectively;•provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of AAG or American are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of AAG or American, respectively; and•provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of AAG’s or American’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Management assessed the effectiveness of AAG’s and American’s internal control over financial reporting as of December\\xa031, 2019. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in its Internal Control\\xa0– Integrated Framework (2013 Framework).158Based on our assessment and those criteria, AAG’s and American’s management concludes that AAG and American, respectively, maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December\\xa031, 2019.AAG’s and American’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of AAG’s and American’s internal control over financial reporting.

(Verizon or the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the world’s leading providers of communications, information and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and government entities. With a presence around the world, we offer voice, data and video services and solutions on our networks that are designed to meet customers’ demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity, security and control. Formerly known as Bell Atlantic Corporation (Bell Atlantic), we were incorporated in 1983 under the laws of the State of Delaware. We began doing business as Verizon on June\\xa030, 2000 following our merger with GTE Corporation. We have a highly diverse workforce of approximately 135,000 employees as of December 31, 2019.Our principal executive offices are located at 1095 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10036 (telephone number 212-395-1000).In November 2018, we announced a strategic reorganization of our business. Under the new structure, effective April 1,\\xa02019, there are two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units - Verizon Consumer Group (Consumer) and Verizon Business Group (Business).Verizon Consumer GroupOur Consumer segment provides consumer-focused wireless and wireline communications services and products. Our wireless services are provided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the United States (U.S.) under the Verizon brand and through wholesale and other arrangements. Our wireline services are provided in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic network under the Fios brand and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios. In 2019, the Consumer segment’s revenues were $91.1 billion, representing approximately 69% of Verizon’s consolidated revenues. As of December\\xa031,\\xa02019, Consumer had approximately 95 million wireless retail connections, 6 million broadband connections and 4\\xa0million Fios video connections.Verizon Business GroupOur Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, video and data services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver various Internet of Things (IoT) services and products. We provide these products and services to businesses, government customers and wireless and wireline carriers across the U.S. and select products and services to customers around the world. In 2019, the Business segment\\'s revenues were $31.4 billion, representing approximately 24% of Verizon’s consolidated revenues. As of December\\xa031,\\xa02019, Business had approximately 25\\xa0million wireless retail postpaid connections and approximately 489\\xa0thousand broadband connections.Additional discussion of our reportable segments is included in the 2019 Verizon Annual Report to Shareholders under the headings \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview\" and - \"Segment Results of Operations\" and in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries, which are incorporated by reference into this report.Service and Product OfferingsOur Consumer segment\\'s wireless and wireline products and services are available to our retail customers, as well as resellers that purchase wireless network access from us on a wholesale basis. Our Business segment’s wireless and wireline products and services are organized by the primary customer groups targeted by these offerings: Global Enterprise, Small and Medium Business, Public Sector and Other, and Wholesale.Wireless We offer wireless services and equipment to customers of both Consumer and Business.Wireless Services Our Consumer and Business segments provide a wide variety of wireless services accessible on a broad range of devices. Customers can obtain our wireless services on a postpaid or prepaid basis. Retail (non-wholesale) postpaid accounts primarily represent retail customers that are directly served and managed by Verizon and use Verizon branded services. A single account may include monthly wireless services for a variety of connected devices. A retail postpaid connection represents an individual line of service for a wireless device for which a customer is generally billed one month in advance for a monthly access charge in return for access to and usage of network services. Our prepaid service is offered only to Consumer customers and enables individuals to obtain wireless services without credit verification by paying for all services in advance. Approximately 96% of our Consumer retail connections were postpaid connections as of December\\xa031,\\xa02019. 4Table of ContentsWe offer various postpaid and prepaid service plans tailored to the needs of our customers. Depending on those needs at a particular time, our plans may include features related to, among other things: unlimited or metered domestic and/or international voice, data, and texting; the ability to share data allowances and/or use data allowances in different periods; high definition voice and video features; the ability to use a device as a Wi-Fi hotspot; and varying data rates depending on the plan and usage on that plan. Our service offerings vary from time to time based on customer needs, technology changes and market conditions and may be provided as standard plans or as part of limited time promotional offers.Access to the Internet is available on all smartphones and nearly all basic phones. In addition, our customers can access the Internet at broadband speeds on notebook computers and tablets that are either wireless-enabled or that are used in conjunction with separate dedicated devices that provide a mobile Wi-Fi connection.As of January 2017, we no longer offer Consumer customers new fixed-term, subsidized service plans for phones; however, we continue to offer subsidized plans to our Business customers. We also continue to service existing plans for customers who have not yet purchased and activated devices under the Verizon device payment program. Wireless EquipmentConsumer and Business offer several categories of wireless equipment to customers, including a variety of smartphones and other handsets, wireless-enabled Internet devices, such as tablets, laptop computers and netbooks, and other wireless-enabled connected devices, such as smart watches and other wearables. In certain cases, we permit customers to acquire equipment from us using device payment plans, which permit the customer to pay for the device in installments over time.Verizon Consumer GroupIn addition to the wireless services and equipment discussed above, Consumer sells residential fixed connectivity solutions, including Internet, video and voice services, and wireless network access to resellers on a wholesale basis. Residential Fixed Services. We provide residential fixed connectivity solutions to customers over our 100% fiber-optic network under the Fios brand, and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios. During 2018, we commercially launched fifth-generation (5G) wireless technology for the home (5G Home) on proprietary standards in four U.S. markets and on global standards in a fifth market in 2019.We offer residential fixed services tailored to the needs of our customers. Depending on those needs at a particular time, our services may include features related to, among other things: Internet access at different speed tiers using fiber-optic, copper or wireless technology; video services that may feature a variety of channel options, video on demand products, cloud-based services and digital video recording capabilities; over-the-top video services; and voice services. Network Access Services. We sell network access to mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) on a wholesale basis, who in turn resell wireless service under their own brand(s) to consumers. Verizon Business Group In addition to the wireless services and equipment discussed above, our Business segment provides communications products and enhanced services, including video and data services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver various IoT products and services. Global EnterpriseGlobal Enterprise offers services to large businesses, which are identified based on their size and volume of business with Verizon, as well as non-U.S. public sector customers. In 2019, Global Enterprise revenues were $10.8 billion, representing approximately 34% of Business’s total revenues.Global Enterprise offers a broad portfolio of connectivity, security and professional services designed to enable our customers to optimize their business operations, mitigate business risks and capitalize on data. These services include the following:•Network Services. We offer a portfolio of network connectivity products to help our customers connect with their employees, partners, vendors, and customers.

Core services also include the provision of customer premises equipment, and installation, maintenance and site services. 5Table of Contents•IoT services. We provide the network access required to deliver various IoT products and services. We work with companies that purchase network access from us to connect their Open Development-certified devices, bundled together with their own solutions, which they sell to end users. We are building IoT capabilities by leveraging business models that monetize usage on our networks at the connectivity, platform and solution layers.Small and Medium BusinessSmall and Medium Business offers wireless services and equipment, tailored voice and networking products, Fios services, IP networking, advanced voice solutions, security and managed information technology (IT) services to our U.S.-based customers that do not meet the requirements to be categorized as Global Enterprise. In 2019, Small and Medium Business revenues were $11.5 billion, representing approximately 36% of Business’s total revenues.In addition to the wireless services and equipment discussed above, Small and Medium Business provides fixed connectivity solutions comparable to the residential fixed services provided by Consumer, as well as business services and connectivity similar to the products and services offered by Global Enterprise, in each case with features and pricing designed to address the needs of small and medium businesses. Public Sector and OtherPublic Sector and Other offers wireless products and services as well as wireline connectivity and managed solutions to U.S. federal, state and local governments and educational institutions. These services include the business services and connectivity similar to the products and services offered by Global Enterprise, in each case, with features and pricing designed to address the needs of governments and educational institutions. In 2019, Public Sector and Other revenues were $5.9 billion, representing approximately 19% of Business’s total revenues.Public Sector and Other also includes solutions that support fleet tracking management, compliance management, field service management, asset tracking and other types of mobile resource management in the United States and around the world. WholesaleWholesale offers wireline communications services including data, voice, local dial tone and broadband services primarily to local, long distance, and wireless carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers. In 2019, Wholesale revenues were $3.2 billion, representing approximately 10% of Business’s total revenues. A portion of Wholesale revenues are generated by a few large telecommunications companies, most of which compete directly with us. Wholesale\\'s services include:•Data services. We offer a portfolio of data services with varying speeds and options to enhance our Wholesale customers’ networks and provide connections to their end-users and subscribers.•Voice services. We provide switched access services that allow carriers to complete their end-user calls that originate or terminate within our territory. In addition, we provide originating and terminating voice services throughout the U.S. and globally utilizing our TDM and VoIP networks.•Local services. We offer an array of local dial tone and broadband services to competitive local exchange carriers, some of which are offered to comply with telecommunications regulations. In addition, we offer services such as colocation, resale and unbundled network elements in compliance with applicable regulations.DistributionWe use a combination of direct, indirect and alternative distribution channels to market and distribute our products and services to Consumer customers. Our direct channel, including our company-operated stores, is a core component of our distribution strategy. Our sales and service centers also represent a significant distribution channel for our services.Our indirect/digital partners channel includes agents that sell our wireless and wireline products and services at retail locations throughout the U.S., as well as through the Internet. The majority of these sales are made under exclusive selling arrangements with us. We also have relationships with high-profile national retailers that sell our wireless and wireline products and services, as well as convenience store chains that sell our wireless prepaid products and services. In 2019, we grew our digital channel and expanded omni channel experiences\\xa0for our customers to offer choice and convenience.In addition to our direct channel, our Business segment has additional distribution channels that include business solution fulfillment provided by resellers, non-stocked device fulfillment performed by distributors and integrated mobility services provided by system integrators and resellers.Competition and Related TrendsThe telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We expect competition to remain intense as traditional and non-traditional participants seek increased market share. 6Table of ContentsWith respect to our wireless connectivity products and services, we compete against other national wireless service providers, including AT&T Inc., Sprint Corporation and T-Mobile USA, Inc., as well as various regional wireless service providers. We also compete for retail activations with resellers that buy bulk wholesale service from wireless service providers, including Verizon, and resell it to their customers. Resellers may include cable companies. Competition remains intense as a result of high rates of smartphone penetration in the wireless market, increased network investment by our competitors, the development and deployment of new technologies, such as 5G, the introduction of new products and services, offerings that include additional premium content, new market entrants, the availability of additional licensed and unlicensed spectrum, and regulatory changes. In 2019, we began offering Apple Music and Disney+ to customers as part of their Unlimited plans. Competition may also increase as smaller, stand-alone wireless service providers merge or transfer licenses to larger, better capitalized wireless service providers and as MVNOs resell wireless communication services.We also face competition from other communications and technology companies seeking to increase their brand recognition and capture customer revenue with respect to the provision of wireless products and services, in addition to non-traditional offerings in mobile data. For example, Microsoft Corporation, Alphabet Inc., Apple Inc. and others are offering alternative means for making wireless voice calls that, in certain cases, can be used in lieu of the wireless provider’s voice service, as well as alternative means of accessing video content. With respect to our wireline connectivity services, we compete against cable companies, wireless service providers, domestic and foreign telecommunications providers, satellite television companies, Internet service providers, over-the-top (OTT) providers and other companies that offer network services and managed enterprise solutions. Cable operators have increased the size and capacity of their networks in order to deliver digital products and services. We introduced offerings that provide customized Internet and video packages. Several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships. Customers have more choices for obtaining video content from various online services. We expect the market will continue to shift from traditional linear video to OTT offerings. We expect customer migration from traditional voice services to wireless services to continue as a growing number of customers place greater value on mobility and wireless companies position their services as a landline alternative. We also face increasing competition from cable operators and other providers of VoIP services, as well as Internet portal providers.We believe that the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the telecommunications industry:•Network reliability, speed and coverage. We consider networks that consistently provide high-quality, fast and reliable service to be a key differentiator in the market and driver of customer satisfaction. Lower prices, improved service quality and new service offerings, which in many cases include video content, have led to increased customer usage of connectivity services. We and other network-based providers must ensure that our networks can meet these increasing capacity usage requirements and offer highly reliable national coverage. •Pricing. With respect to wireless services and equipment, pricing plays an important role in the wireless competitive landscape. As the demand for wireless services continues to grow, wireless service providers are offering a range of service plans at competitive prices. Many wireless service providers also bundle wireless service offerings with other products and offer promotional pricing and incentives, some of which may be targeted specifically to customers of Verizon. We and other wireless service providers, as well as equipment manufacturers, offer device payment options, which provide customers with the ability to pay for their device over a period of time, and some providers offer device leasing arrangements. In addition, aggressive device promotions have become more common in an effort to gain a greater share of subscribers interested in changing carriers. With respect to wireline services, pricing is used by competitors to capture market share from incumbents, and it is a significant factor as non-traditional modes of providing communication services emerge and new entrants compete for customers. For example, VoIP and portal-based voice and video calling is often free or nearly free to customers and is often supported by advertising revenues.•Customer service. We believe that high-quality customer service is a key factor in retaining customers and attracting new customers, including those of other providers. Our customer service, retention and satisfaction programs are based on providing customers with convenient and easy-to-use products and services and focusing on their needs in order to promote long-term relationships and minimize churn. The Verizon Up program, for example, was launched to promote long-term relationships with our Consumer customers. The program offers a variety of rewards to customers in exchange for points in connection with their account-related transactions. Customer service is highly valued by our Business customers. We provide Global Enterprise and Public Sector and Other customers with ready access to their system and performance information, and we conduct proactive testing of our networks to identify issues before they affect our customers. We service our Small and Medium Business customers through service representatives and online support, as well as through store-based representatives for small business customers. For Wholesale customers, we pursue service improvement through continued system automation initiatives.•Product differentiation. Customer and revenue growth are increasingly dependent on the development of new and enhanced products and services, as the delivery of new and innovative products and services has been accelerating. Customers are shifting their focus from access to applications and are seeking ways to leverage their broadband, video and wireless connections. To compete effectively, providers need to continuously review, improve and refine their product portfolio and develop and rapidly deploy new products and services tailored to the needs of customers. We continue to pursue the development and rapid deployment of new and innovative products and services, both independently and in collaboration with application providers, content providers and device manufacturers. Features such as wireless and wireline inter-operability are becoming increasingly important, driven by both customer demand and technological advancement. 7Table of Contents•Sales and distribution. A key to achieving sales success in the consumer and small and medium business sectors of the wireless industry is the reach and quality of sales channels and distribution points. We seek to optimally vary distribution channels among our company-operated stores selling wireless products and services, outside sales teams and telemarketing, web-based sales and fulfillment capabilities, our extensive indirect distribution network of retail outlets and our sale of wireless service to resellers, which resell wireless services to their end-users.In addition to these competitive factors and trends, companies with a global presence are increasingly competing with us in our Business segment. A relatively small number of telecommunications and integrated service providers with global operations serve customers in the global enterprise market and, to a lesser extent, the global wholesale market. We compete with these providers for large contracts to provide integrated solutions to global enterprises. Many of these companies have strong market presence, brand recognition and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to intensifying competition that may affect our future revenue growth. In the Global Enterprise and Public Sector and Other markets, competition remains high, primarily as a result of increased industry focus on technology convergence. We compete in this area with system integrators, carriers, and hardware and software providers. In addition, some of the largest information technology services companies are making strategic acquisitions, divesting non-strategic assets and forging new alliances to improve their cost structure. Many new alliances and acquisitions have focused on emerging fields, such as cloud computing, software defined network, communication applications and other computing tasks via networks, rather than by the use of in-house machines. In the Small and Medium Business market, customer purchasing behaviors and preferences continue to evolve. Solution speed and simplicity with user interfaces that have a consumer-like \"look and feel\" are becoming key differentiators for customers who are seeking full life-cycle offers that simplify the process of starting, running and growing their businesses. Several major cable operators also offer bundles with wireless services through strategic relationships. Our Wholesale business competes with traditional carriers for long-haul, voice and IP services. In addition, mobile video and data needs are driving a greater need for wireless backhaul. Network providers, cable companies and niche players are competitors for this business opportunity.Verizon MediaOur media business, Verizon Media, includes diverse media and technology brands that serve both consumers and businesses. Verizon Media provides consumers with owned and operated and third-party search properties as well as mail, news, finance, sports and entertainment offerings, and provides other businesses and partners access to consumers through digital advertising, content delivery and video streaming platforms. In 2019, Verizon Media\\'s revenues were $7.5 billion.Verizon Media Products and SolutionsAd PlatformOur Verizon Media Ad Platform provides advertisers and publishers with a simplified suite of intelligent advertising solutions across desktop, mobile and television devices. Verizon Media\\'s business is comprised primarily of search advertising, display advertising, Ecommerce and subscriptions.•Search advertising. Our search properties serve as a guide for users to discover information on the Internet. Verizon Media serves click-based search advertisements generated by proprietary algorithmic technology, as well as advertisements from partners. Verizon Media provides the underlying search products that facilitate user searches within Verizon Media and third-party partner properties. •Display advertising. Display advertising is made up of both graphical and performance-based advertising and takes the form of impression-based contracts, time-based contracts and performance-based contracts. Verizon Media display ads leverage proprietary data signals to identify and engage users on Verizon Media properties and across the web. Through Verizon Media Ad Platform, we provide customers the ability to buy advertising inventory, measure campaigns across screens and advertising formats using self-serve technology or our managed services. We also provide publishers with the ability to monetize their ad inventory. •Ecommerce. Our Ecommerce offering includes different types of business models, including facilitating transactions between businesses and consumers, enabling businesses that facilitate transactions for other businesses, and facilitating transactions between consumers.•Subscription memberships. Our paid subscription offerings include premium content and services across our mail, news, finance, sports and entertainment properties, privacy and security solutions and computer protection.Verizon Media PlatformAs the digital platform reshapes the delivery of media and entertainment content, there is an increasing need for stable, high-quality video delivery platforms. Our Media Platform offers a scalable platform for delivering content, including live broadcasts, video on demand, games, software and websites to our customers on their devices at any time. This platform is targeted at media and entertainment companies and other businesses that deliver their digital products and services through the Internet.8Table of ContentsGlobal Network and Technology Our global network architecture is used by both Consumer and Business. Our network technology platforms include both wireless and wireline technologies. Network Evolution We are evolving the architecture of our networks to a next-generation multi-use platform, providing improved efficiency and virtualization, increased automation and opportunities for edge computing services that will support both our fiber-based and radio access network technologies. We call this the Intelligent Edge Network. We expect that this new architecture will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements, improve our fourth-generation (4G) Long-Term Evolution (LTE) wireless coverage, speed the deployment of 5G wireless technology and create new opportunities in the business market. 5G Deployment Over the past several years, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless technology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and mobile 5G wireless services. We believe 5G technology will be able to provide users with eight capabilities, or currencies. The eight currencies are peak data rates, mobile data volumes, mobility, number of connected devices, energy efficiency of connected devices, service deployment, reduced latency and improved reliability. We expect that 5G technology will provide higher throughput and lower latency than the current 4G LTE technology and enable our networks to handle more traffic as the number of Internet-connected devices grows. During 2018, we commercially launched 5G Home on proprietary standards in four U.S. markets and on global standards in a fifth U.S. market in 2019. We also launched our 5G Ultra Wideband Network in 31 U.S. markets in 2019, as well as several 5G-compatible smartphones. 4G LTE Our primary wireless network technology platform is 4G LTE, which provides higher data throughput performance for data services at a lower cost compared to that offered by 3G technology. As of December\\xa031,\\xa02019, our 4G LTE network is available in over 700 markets covering approximately 327 million people, including those in areas served by our LTE in Rural America partners. Under this program, we have collaborated with wireless carriers in rural areas to build and operate a 4G LTE network using each carrier’s network assets and our core 4G LTE equipment and 700 Megahertz (MHz) C Block and Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) spectrum. Wireless Network Reliability and Build-Out We consider the reliability, coverage and speed of our wireless network as key factors for our continued success. We believe that steady and consistent network and platform investments provide the foundation for innovative products and services. As we design and deploy our network, we focus on the number of successful data sessions the network enables, delivering on our advertised throughput speeds, and the number of calls that are connected on the first attempt and completed without being dropped. We utilize three strategies to maintain the quality of our network: increasing the density of our network elements, deploying new technologies as they are developed and putting additional wireless spectrum into service. We choose among these strategies based on the circumstances present at different times in each of our service areas.We have been densifying our network by utilizing small cell technology, in-building solutions and distributed antenna systems. Network densification enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video consumption and the growing demand for IoT products and services on our 4G LTE and 5G networks. We are also utilizing existing network capabilities to handle increased traffic without interrupting the quality of the customer experience. We continue to deploy advanced technologies to increase both network capacity and data rates. In order to build and upgrade our existing 4G LTE network and deploy our 5G network, we must complete a variety of steps, which can include securing rights to a large number of sites as well as obtaining zoning and other governmental approvals and fiber facilities, for our macro and small cells, in-building systems and antennas and related radio equipment that comprise distributed antenna systems. We have relationships with a wide variety of vendors that supply various products and services that support our wireless network operations. We utilize tower site management firms as lessors or managers of a portion of our existing leased and owned tower sites.Our networks include various elements of redundancy designed to enhance the reliability of the services provided to our customers. To mitigate the impact of power disruptions on our operations, we have battery backup at every switch and every macro cell. We also utilize backup generators at a majority of our macro cells and at every switch location. In addition, we have a fleet of portable backup generators that can be deployed, if needed. We further enhance reliability by using a fully redundant Multiprotocol Label Switching backbone network in critical locations.In addition to our own network coverage, we have roaming agreements with a number of wireless service providers to enable our customers to receive wireless service in nearly all other areas in the U.S. where wireless service is available. We also offer a variety of international wireless voice and data services to our customers through roaming arrangements with wireless service providers outside the U.S. Fios Residential broadband service has seen significant growth in bandwidth demand over the past several years, and we believe that demand will continue to grow. We expect the continued emergence of new video services, new data applications and the proliferation of IP devices in the home will continue to drive new network requirements for increased data speeds and throughput. We believe that the Passive Optical Network (PON) technology underpinning Fios positions us well to meet these demands in a cost-effective and efficient manner. 9Table of ContentsWhile deployed initially as a consumer broadband network, our PON infrastructure is also experiencing more widespread application in the Business segment, especially as businesses increasingly migrate to Ethernet-based access services.Global IP Verizon owns and operates one of the largest global fiber-optic networks in the world, providing connectivity to Business customers in more than 150 countries. Our global IP network includes long-haul, metro and submarine assets that span over 1 million route miles and enable and support international operations.Global business is rapidly evolving to an \"everything-as-a-service\" model in which Business customers seek cloud-based, converged enterprise solutions delivered securely via managed and professional services. We are continuing to deploy packet optical transport technology in order to create a global network platform to meet this demand.SpectrumThe spectrum licenses we hold can be used for mobile wireless voice, video and data communications services. We are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to provide these wireless services on portions of the 800 MHz band, also known as cellular spectrum, the 1800-1900 MHz band, also known as Personal Communication Services (PCS) spectrum, portions of the 700 MHz upper C band and AWS 1 and 3 spectrum in the 1700 and 2100 MHz bands, in areas that, collectively, cover nearly all of the population of the U.S. This spectrum is collectively called low and mid-band spectrum. We are using our low and mid-band spectrum to provide both 3G and 4G LTE wireless services. However, we are increasingly reallocating spectrum previously used for 3G service to provide 4G LTE service. We are also repurposing low and mid-band spectrum to complement our spectrum licenses in the 28 and 39 Gigahertz (GHz) band, collectively called millimeter wave spectrum.Millimeter wave spectrum is being used for our 5G technology deployment. We anticipate that we will need additional spectrum to meet future demand. This increasing demand is driven by growth in customer connections and the increased usage of wireless broadband services that use more bandwidth and require faster rates of speed, as well as the wider deployment of 5G mobile and fixed services. We can meet our future 4G and 5G spectrum needs by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees, or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the FCC, if and when future FCC spectrum auctions occur. From time to time we have exchanged spectrum licenses with other wireless service providers through secondary market swap transactions. We expect to continue to pursue similar opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet capacity and expansion needs in the future. In certain cases, we have entered into intra-market spectrum swaps designed to increase the amount of contiguous spectrum within frequency bands in a specific market. Contiguous spectrum improves network performance and efficiency. These swaps, as well as any spectrum purchases, require us to obtain governmental approvals.Information regarding spectrum license transactions is included in the 2019 Verizon Annual Report to Shareholders in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries, which is incorporated by reference into this report.Strategic TransactionsDuring March 2015, we completed a transaction with American Tower Corporation (American Tower) pursuant to which American Tower acquired the exclusive rights to lease and operate approximately 11,300 of our wireless towers and corresponding ground leases for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion. We have subleased capacity on the towers from American Tower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates, with options to renew. Under the terms of the lease agreements, American Tower has exclusive rights to lease and operate towers over an average term of approximately 28 years. As the leases expire, American Tower has fixed-price purchase options to acquire these towers based on their anticipated fair market values at the end of the lease terms. As part of this transaction, we also sold 162 towers for $71 million.In June 2015, we completed our acquisition of AOL Inc. (AOL), a leader in digital content and advertising. The aggregate cash consideration paid by Verizon at the closing was approximately $3.8 billion.In April 2016, we completed the sale (Access Line Sale) of our local exchange business and related landline activities in California, Florida and Texas, including Fios Internet and video customers, switched and special access lines and high-speed Internet service and long distance voice accounts in these three states to Frontier Communications Corporation (Frontier) for approximately $10.5\\xa0billion (approximately $7.3 billion net of income taxes), subject to certain adjustments and including the assumption of $612 million of indebtedness from Verizon by Frontier. The transaction included the acquisition by Frontier of the equity interests of Verizon’s incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) in California, Florida and Texas.The transaction resulted in Frontier acquiring approximately 3.3 million voice connections, 1.6 million Fios Internet subscribers, 1.2\\xa0million Fios video subscribers and the related ILEC businesses from Verizon. Approximately 9,300 Verizon employees who served customers in California, Florida and Texas continued employment with Frontier.In July 2016, we acquired Telogis, Inc., a global, cloud-based mobile enterprise management software business, for $877 million of cash consideration.10Table of ContentsIn November 2016, we completed the acquisition of Fleetmatics Group PLC, a global provider of fleet and mobile workforce management solutions, for $60.00 per ordinary share in cash. The aggregate merger consideration was approximately $2.5 billion, including cash acquired of $112 million.In December\\xa02016, we entered into a definitive agreement, which was subsequently amended in March 2017, with Equinix, Inc. (Equinix) pursuant to which we agreed to sell 23 customer-facing data center sites in the U.S. and Latin America for approximately $3.6 billion, subject to certain adjustments (Data Center Sale). The transaction closed in May 2017.In February\\xa02016, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire XO Holdings\\' wireline business (XO), which owned and operated one of the largest fiber-based IP and Ethernet networks in the U.S. Concurrently, we entered into a separate agreement to utilize certain wireless spectrum from a wholly-owned subsidiary of XO Holdings, NextLink, that held XO\\'s millimeter-wave wireless spectrum. The agreement included an option, subject to certain conditions, to acquire NextLink. In February 2017, we completed our acquisition of XO for total cash consideration of approximately $1.5 billion, of which $100 million was paid in 2015.In April 2017, we exercised our option to buy NextLink for approximately $493 million, subject to certain adjustments, of which $320 million was prepaid in the first quarter of 2017. The transaction closed in January 2018. The acquisition of NextLink was accounted for as an asset acquisition, as substantially all of the value related to the acquired spectrum. Upon closing, we recorded approximately $657 million of wireless licenses, $110 million of a deferred tax liability and $58 million of other liabilities.In June 2017, we completed our acquisition of the operating business of Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo), a leader in search, communications, digital content and advertising. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, we agreed to acquire the stock of one or more subsidiaries of Yahoo holding all of Yahoo’s operating business for approximately $4.83 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments. In February 2017, Verizon and Yahoo entered into an amendment to the Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Transaction purchase price was reduced by $350 million to approximately $4.48 billion in cash, subject to certain adjustments.In August 2017, we entered into a definitive agreement to purchase certain fiber-optic network assets in the Chicago market from WideOpenWest, Inc. (WOW!), a leading provider of communications services. The transaction closed in December 2017. In addition, the parties entered into a separate agreement pursuant to which WOW! was to complete the build-out of the network assets in 2019. This build-out was completed in 2019. The total cash consideration for the transactions was approximately $275 million, of which $226 million was paid in December 2017. During 2019 and 2018, the remaining cash consideration was paid. In 2017, we entered into a transaction to acquire Straight Path Communications Inc., which held certain millimeter-wave spectrum licenses. The transaction closed in February 2018 for total consideration reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $3.1 billion. We are using the spectrum acquired for our 5G technology deployment.Additional information regarding certain of these strategic transactions is included in the 2019 Verizon Annual Report to Shareholders in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries, which is incorporated by reference into this report.Patents, Trademarks and LicensesWe own or have licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names and other intellectual property rights necessary to conduct our business. We actively pursue the filing and registration of patents, copyrights, domain names, trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property rights within the United States and abroad. We also actively grant licenses, in exchange for appropriate fees or other consideration and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions, to other companies that enable them to utilize certain of our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology as part of their products and services. Such licenses enable the licensees to take advantage of the results of Verizon’s research and development efforts. While these licenses result in valuable consideration for Verizon, we do not believe that the loss of such consideration, or the expiration of any of our intellectual property rights, would have a material effect on our results of operations.We periodically receive offers from third parties to purchase or obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual property rights in exchange for royalties or other payments. We also periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third-party patents or other intellectual property rights. These claims, whether against us directly or against third-party suppliers of products or services that we sell to our customers, if successful, could require us to pay damages or royalties, or cease offering the relevant products or services.Acquisitions and DivestituresInformation about our acquisitions and divestitures is included in the 2019 Verizon Annual Report to Shareholders under the heading \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Acquisitions and Divestitures\" and in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon Communications Inc. and subsidiaries, which is incorporated by reference into this report.11Table of ContentsRegulatory and Competitive TrendsRegulatory and Competitive LandscapeVerizon operates in a regulated and highly competitive market. Current and potential competitors include other voice and data service providers, such as other wireless companies, traditional telephone companies, cable companies, Internet service providers, software and application providers and other non-traditional competitors. Many of these companies have strong market presence, brand recognition and existing customer relationships, all of which contribute to a highly competitive market that may affect our future revenue growth. Some of our competitors also are subject to fewer regulatory constraints than Verizon. For many services offered by Verizon, the FCC is our primary regulator. The FCC has jurisdiction over interstate telecommunications services and other matters under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act or Act). Other Verizon services are subject to state and local regulation.Federal, State and Local RegulationWireless ServicesThe FCC regulates several aspects of our wireless operations. Generally, the FCC has jurisdiction over the construction, operation, acquisition and transfer of wireless communications systems. All wireless services require use of radio frequency spectrum, the assignment and distribution of which is subject to FCC oversight. Verizon anticipates that it will need additional spectrum to meet future demand. We can meet our needs for licensed spectrum by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum from others, or by participating in a competitive bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the FCC. Those processes are subject to certain reviews, approvals and potential conditions.Today, Verizon holds FCC spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services, including both voice and data services. FCC spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years, at which time they are subject to renewal. While the FCC has routinely renewed all of Verizon’s wireless licenses, challenges could be raised in the future. If a wireless license was revoked or not renewed, Verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by that license. Some of our licenses require us to comply with so-called \"open access\" FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice, subject to certain technical limitations. The FCC has also imposed certain specific mandates on wireless carriers, including construction and geographic coverage requirements, technical operating standards, provision of enhanced 911 services, roaming obligations and requirements for wireless tower and antenna facilities.The Act generally preempts regulation by state and local governments of the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless carriers. The Act does not prohibit states from regulating the other \"terms and conditions\" of wireless service. For example, some states attempt to regulate wireless customer billing matters and impose reporting requirements. Several states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues (e.g., use of wireless handsets while driving) and taxation matters. In addition, wireless tower and antenna facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land use regulation, and securing approvals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process.BroadbandVerizon offers many different broadband services. Traditionally, the FCC recognized broadband Internet access services as \"information services\" subject to a \"light touch\" regulatory approach rather than to the traditional, utilities-style regulations. In 2015, the FCC declared that broadband Internet access services are \"telecommunications services\" subject to common carriage regulation under Title II of the Communications Act. In December 2017, the FCC adopted an order reversing the 2015 Title II Order to return to \"light touch\" regulation of broadband Internet access services. The \"light touch\" portions of this order have been upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit but further appeals are likely. The part of the FCC order automatically preempting state action on the subject was vacated, and a number of states are likely to join those that have taken steps to regulate broadband. Regardless of regulation, Verizon remains committed to the open Internet, which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content, and our commitment to our customers can be found on our website at http://responsibility.verizon.com/broadband-commitment.Wireline VoiceVerizon offers many different wireline voice services, including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on technologies such as VoIP. For regulatory purposes, legacy telephone services are generally considered to be \"common carrier\" services. Common carrier services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to rates, terms and conditions and other aspects of the services. The FCC has not decided the regulatory classification of VoIP but has said VoIP service providers must comply with certain rules, such as 911 capabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements.State public utility commissions regulate Verizon’s telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate matters. Verizon operates as an \"incumbent local exchange carrier\" in nine states and the District of Columbia. These incumbent operations are subject to various levels of pricing flexibility and other state oversight and requirements. Verizon also has other wireline operations that are more lightly regulated.VideoVerizon offers a multichannel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service. The FCC has a body of rules that apply to cable operators, and these rules also generally apply to Verizon. In areas where Verizon offers its facilities-based multichannel video services, Verizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities, or in some cases a state-wide franchise, and comply with certain one-time and ongoing obligations as a result.12Table of ContentsPrivacy and Data SecurityWe are subject to federal, state and international laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security that impact all parts of our business, including wireline, wireless, broadband and the development and roll out of new products, such as those in the media and IoT space. At the federal level, our voice business is subject to the FCC\\'s privacy requirements. Oversight of broadband Internet access privacy and data security is governed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Generally, attention to privacy and data security requirements is increasing at both the state and federal level, and several privacy-related bills have been introduced or are under considerations at each level. Europe\\'s General Data Protection Regulation, which went into effect in May 2018, includes significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, a new privacy law took effect in California at the beginning of 2020, an additional privacy law is scheduled to take effect in Maine in 2020, and other states are considering additional regulations. These regulations could have a significant impact on our businesses. Public Safety and CybersecurityThe FCC plays a role in addressing public safety concerns by regulating emergency communications services and mandating widespread availability of both media (broadcast/cable) and wireless emergency alerting services. In response to cyber attacks that have occurred or could occur in the future, however, the FCC or other regulators may attempt to increase regulation of the cybersecurity practices of providers. The FCC is also addressing the use by American companies of equipment produced by companies imposing potential national security risks, but Verizon does not use such equipment in its network. In addition, due to recent natural disasters, federal and state agencies may attempt to impose regulations to ensure continuity of service during disasters.Intercarrier Compensation and Network AccessThe FCC regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic (particularly traditional wireline traffic) over different networks and other aspects of interconnection for some voice services. The FCC also regulates some of the rates and terms and conditions for certain wireline \"business data services\" and other services and network facilities. Verizon is both a seller and a buyer of these services, and both makes and receives interconnection payments. The FCC has focused in recent years on whether changes in the rates, terms and conditions for both the exchange of traffic and for business data services may be appropriate.Information About Our Executive OfficersSee Part III, Item 10. \"Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about our executive officers.EmployeesAs of December\\xa031,\\xa02019, Verizon and its subsidiaries had approximately 135,000 employees.

This information should be read in conjunction with \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations\" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The following discussion of risks is not all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our business and expectations. These factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forward-looking statements.Operational RisksCyber attacks impacting our networks or systems could have an adverse effect on our business.Cyber attacks, including through the use of malware, computer viruses, dedicated denial of services attacks, credential harvesting, social engineering and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our networks and systems and those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers, could have an adverse effect on our business. Cyber attacks may cause equipment failures, loss of information, including sensitive personal information of customers or employees or valuable technical and marketing information, as well as disruptions to our or our customers’ operations.\\xa0Cyber attacks against companies, including Verizon, have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. They may occur alone or in conjunction with physical attacks, especially where disruption of service is an objective of the attacker. The development and maintenance of systems to prevent such attacks is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating to address their increasing prevalence and sophistication. While, to date, we have not been subject to cyber attacks that, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to Verizon\\'s operations or financial condition, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks, including protection of our systems and networks, may be insufficient to repel or mitigate the effects of a major cyber attack in the future.The inability to operate or use our networks and systems or those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers as a result of cyber attacks, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses to Verizon and/or a loss of market share to other communications providers. The costs associated with a major cyber attack on Verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners to retain their business, increased expenditures on cybersecurity measures and the use of alternate resources, lost revenues from business interruption and litigation. Further, certain of Verizon’s businesses, such as those offering security solutions and infrastructure and cloud services to business customers, could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a result of a cyber attack. Our presence in the IoT industry, which includes offerings of telematics products and services, could also increase our exposure to potential costs and expenses and reputational harm in the event of cyber attacks impacting these products or services. In addition, a compromise of security or a theft or other compromise of valuable information, such as financial data and sensitive\\xa0or private personal information, could result in lawsuits and government claims, investigations or proceedings.\\xa0Any of these occurrences could damage our reputation, adversely impact customer and investor confidence and result in a material adverse effect on Verizon’s results of operation\\xa0or financial condition.Natural disasters, terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations.Our business operations are subject to interruption by power outages, terrorist attacks, other hostile acts and natural disasters, including an increasing prevalence of wildfires and intensified storm activities. Such events could cause significant damage to our infrastructure upon which our business operations rely, resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers, as well as significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. Our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate to sustain our operations through all such events. We are implementing, and will continue to implement, measures to protect our infrastructure and operations from the impacts of these events in the future, but these measures and our overall disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. These events could also damage the infrastructure of the suppliers that provide us with the equipment and services that we need to operate our business and provide products to our customers. These occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption, damage to our reputation and reduced profits.We depend on key suppliers and vendors to provide equipment that we need to operate our business.We depend on various key suppliers and vendors to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with equipment and services, such as fiber, switch and network equipment, smartphones and other wireless devices that we need in order to operate our business and provide products to our customers. For example, our smartphone and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical components, such as chipsets, used in their devices, and there are a limited number of companies capable of supplying the network infrastructure equipment on which we depend. These suppliers or vendors could fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis, or fail to meet our performance expectations, for a number of reasons, including, for example, disruption to the global supply chain as a result of the coronavirus. If such failures occur, we may be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers, or we may be unable to continue to maintain or upgrade our networks. Because of the cost and time lag that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another, our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with products or services from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. Any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.The suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including litigation involving claims of patent infringement. Such claims are frequently made in the communications industry. We are unable to predict whether our 15Table of Contentsbusiness will be affected by any such litigation. We expect our dependence on key suppliers to continue as we develop and introduce more advanced generations of technology.A significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions, and we could incur additional costs or experience work stoppages as a result of the renegotiation of our labor contracts.As of December\\xa031,\\xa02019, approximately 23% of our workforce was represented by labor unions. While we have labor contracts in place with these unions, with subsequent negotiations we could incur additional costs and/or experience work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business operations. In addition, while a small percentage of the workforce of our wireless and other businesses outside of wireline is represented by unions, we cannot predict what level of success unions may have in further organizing this workforce or the potentially negative impact it would have on our operations.Economic and Strategic RisksWe face significant competition that may reduce our profits.We face significant competition in our industries. The rapid development of new technologies, services and products have eliminated many of the traditional distinctions among wireless, cable, Internet and local and long distance communication services and brought new competitors to our markets, including other telephone companies, cable companies, wireless service providers, satellite providers and application and device providers. While these changes have enabled us to offer new types of products and services, they have also allowed other providers to broaden the scope of their own competitive offerings. If we are unable to compete effectively, we could experience lower than expected revenues and earnings. A projected sustained decline in any of our reporting units\\' revenues and earnings could have a significant impact on its fair value and has caused us in the past, and may cause us in the future, to record goodwill impairment charges. The amount of any impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations for the period in which the charge is taken. In addition, wireless service providers are significantly altering the financial relationships with their customers through commercial offers that vary service and device pricing, promotions, incentives and levels of service provided – in some cases specifically targeting our customers. Our ability to compete effectively will depend on, among other things, our network quality, capacity and coverage, the pricing of our products and services, the quality of our customer service, our development of new and enhanced products and services, the reach and quality of our sales and distribution channels and our capital resources. It will also depend on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various factors affecting our industries, including new technologies and business models, changes in consumer preferences and demand for existing services, demographic trends and economic conditions. If we are not able to respond successfully to these competitive challenges, we could experience reduced profits.If we are not able to take advantage of developments in technology and address changing consumer demand on a timely basis, we may experience a decline in the demand for our services, be unable to implement our business strategy and experience reduced profits.Our industries are rapidly changing as new technologies are developed that offer consumers an array of choices for their communications needs and allow new entrants into the markets we serve. In order to grow and remain competitive, we will need to adapt to future changes in technology, enhance our existing offerings and introduce new offerings to address our customers’ changing demands. If we are unable to meet future challenges from competing technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost, we could lose customers to our competitors. We may not be able to accurately predict technological trends or the success of new services in the market. The deployment of our 5G network is subject to a variety of risks, including those related to equipment availability, unexpected costs, and regulatory permitting requirements that could cause deployment delays or network performance issues. These issues could result in significant costs or reduce the anticipated benefits of the enhancements to our networks. If our services fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace, or if costs associated with the implementation and introduction of these services materially increase, our ability to retain and attract customers could be adversely affected. In addition to introducing new offerings and technologies, such as 5G technology, we must phase out outdated and unprofitable technologies and services. If we are unable to do so on a cost-effective basis, we could experience reduced profits. In addition, there could be legal or regulatory restraints on our ability to phase out current services.Adverse conditions in the U.S. and international economies could impact our results of operations.Unfavorable economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the U.S. or elsewhere, could negatively affect the affordability of and demand for some of our products and services. In difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products, electing to use fewer higher margin services, dropping down in price plans or obtaining lower-cost products and services offered by other companies. Similarly, under these conditions, the business customers that we serve may delay purchasing decisions, delay full implementation of service offerings or reduce their use of services. In addition, adverse economic conditions may lead to an increased number of our consumer and business customers that are unable to pay for services. If these events were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.16Table of ContentsRegulatory and Legal RisksChanges in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations.Our domestic operations are subject to regulation by the FCC and other federal, state and local agencies, and our international operations are regulated by various foreign governments and international bodies. These regulatory regimes frequently restrict or impose conditions on our ability to operate in designated areas and provide specified products or services. We are frequently required to maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards. We are often involved in regulatory and other governmental proceedings or inquiries related to the application of these requirements. It is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending federal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations, or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. Without relief, existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. Similarly, we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing licenses. For example, the FCC grants wireless licenses for terms generally lasting 10 years, subject to renewal. The loss of, or a material limitation on, certain of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.New laws or regulations or changes to the existing regulatory framework at the federal, state and local, or international level, such as those described below, or new laws or regulations enacted to address the potential impacts of climate change, could restrict the ways in which we manage our wireline and wireless networks and operate our Media business, impose additional costs, impair revenue opportunities and potentially impede our ability to provide services in a manner that would be attractive to us and our customers. •Privacy and data protection - we are subject to federal, state and international laws related to privacy and data protection. Europe\\'s General Data Protection Regulation, which went into effect in May 2018, includes significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, a new privacy law took effect in California at the beginning of 2020, an additional privacy law is scheduled to take effect in Maine in 2020, and other states are considering additional regulations. These regulations could have a significant impact on our businesses.  •Regulation of broadband Internet access services - In its 2015 Title II Order, the FCC nullified its longstanding \"light touch\" approach to regulating broadband Internet access services and \"reclassified\" these services as telecommunications services subject to utilities-style common carriage regulation. The FCC repealed the 2015 Title II Order in December 2017, and returned to its traditional light-touch approach for these services. The 2017 order has been affirmed in part by the D.C. Circuit, but further appeals and challenges are possible; the outcome and timing of these or any other challenge remains uncertain. Several states have also adopted or are considering adopting laws or executive orders that would impose net neutrality and other requirements on some of our services (in some cases different from the FCC’s 2015 rules). The enforceability and effect of these state rules is uncertain.•\"Open Access\" - we hold certain wireless licenses that require us to comply with so-called \"open access\" FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use devices and applications of their choice. Moreover, certain services could be subject to conflicting regulation by the FCC and/or various state and local authorities, which could significantly increase the cost of implementing and introducing new services. The further regulation of broadband, wireless and our other activities and any related court decisions could restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our networks.We are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements.We are subject to a substantial amount of litigation, including, from time to time, shareholder derivative suits, patent infringement lawsuits, antitrust class actions, wage and hour class actions, personal injury claims, property claims, and lawsuits relating to our advertising, sales, billing and collection practices. In addition, our wireless business also faces personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits relating to alleged health effects of wireless phones or radio frequency transmitters. We may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or settlements.Financial RisksVerizon has significant debt, which could increase further if Verizon incurs additional debt in the future and does not retire existing debt.As of December\\xa031,\\xa02019, Verizon had approximately $99.1\\xa0billion of outstanding unsecured indebtedness, $9.4\\xa0billion of unused borrowing capacity under its existing revolving credit facility and $12.4 billion of outstanding secured indebtedness. Verizon’s debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including:•requiring Verizon to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on its debt, which would reduce the funds Verizon has available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments and acquisitions;•making it more difficult or expensive for Verizon to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes;•reducing Verizon’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its industries and market conditions;•making Verizon more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in its business; and17Table of Contents•exposing Verizon to increased interest rate risk to the extent that its debt obligations are at variable interest rates.Adverse changes in the credit markets and other factors could increase our borrowing costs and the availability of financing.We require a significant amount of capital to operate and grow our business. We fund our capital needs in part through borrowings in the public and private credit markets. Adverse changes in the credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or refinance existing indebtedness. In addition, our ability to obtain funding under asset-backed debt transactions is subject to our ability to continue to originate a sufficient amount of assets eligible to be securitized. Our borrowing costs also can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on our performance as measured by customary credit metrics. A decrease in these ratings would likely increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult for us to obtain financing. A severe disruption in the global financial markets could impact some of the financial institutions with which we do business, and such instability could also affect our access to financing.Increases in costs for pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits may reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments.With approximately 135,000 employees and approximately 191,000 retirees as of December\\xa031,\\xa02019 eligible to participate in Verizon’s benefit plans, the costs of pension benefits and active and retiree healthcare benefits have a significant impact on our profitability. Our costs of maintaining these plans, and the future funding requirements for these plans, are affected by several factors, including the legislative and regulatory uncertainty regarding the potential modification of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, increases in healthcare costs, decreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts and changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions used to calculate pension and other postretirement expenses. If we are unable to limit future increases in the costs of our benefit plans, those costs could reduce our profitability and increase our funding commitments.Item\\xa01B.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item\\xa02.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0PropertiesOur principal properties do not lend themselves to simple description by character and location.

We are cooperating with this investigation and continue to review our operations relating to the management of hazardous waste. While penalties relating to the alleged violations could exceed $100,000, we do not expect that any penalties ultimately incurred will be material.

As of December\\xa031,\\xa02019, there were 605,414 shareholders of record.Stock RepurchasesIn February 2020, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized a share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million shares of the Company\\'s common stock. The program will terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches 100 million, or a new share repurchase plan superseding the current plan is authorized, whichever is sooner. Under the program, shares may be  repurchased in privately negotiated transactions, on the open market, or otherwise, including through plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. The timing and number of shares purchased under the program, if any, will depend on market conditions and the Company\\'s capital allocation priorities.During the years ended December\\xa031,\\xa02019 and 2018, Verizon did not repurchase any shares of Verizon’s common stock under our previously authorized share buyback program. At December\\xa031, 2019, the maximum number of shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of Verizon under our share buyback program was 100 million.

Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements. See Item\\xa01A of Part I — “Risk Factors.”Amazon.com, Inc. was incorporated in 1994 in the state of Washington and reincorporated in 1996 in the state of Delaware. Our principal corporate offices are located in Seattle, Washington. We completed our initial public offering in May 1997 and our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “AMZN.”As used herein, “Amazon.com,” “we,” “our,” and similar terms include Amazon.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.GeneralWe seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. We are guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. In addition, we provide services, such as advertising to sellers, vendors, publishers, and authors, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. Information on our net sales is contained in Item\\xa08 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 10 — Segment Information.” The financial results of Whole Foods Market, Inc. (“Whole Foods Market”) have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition on August 28, 2017.ConsumersWe serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We design our stores to enable hundreds of millions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product categories. Customers access our offerings through our websites, mobile apps, Alexa, devices, streaming, and physically visiting our stores. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices, including Kindle, Fire tablet, Fire TV, Echo, Ring, and other devices, and we develop and produce media content. We seek to offer our customers low prices, fast and free delivery, easy-to-use functionality, and timely customer service. In addition, we offer Amazon Prime, a membership program that includes unlimited free shipping on over 100 million items, access to unlimited streaming of tens of thousands of movies and TV episodes, including Amazon Original content, and other benefits.We fulfill customer orders in a number of ways, including through: North America and International fulfillment and delivery networks that we operate; co-sourced and outsourced arrangements in certain countries; digital delivery; and through our physical stores. We operate customer service centers globally, which are supplemented by co-sourced arrangements. See Item\\xa02 of Part\\xa0I, “Properties.”SellersWe offer programs that enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. We earn fixed fees, a percentage of sales, per-unit activity fees, interest, or some combination thereof, for our seller programs.Developers and EnterprisesWe serve developers and enterprises of all sizes, including start-ups, government agencies, and academic institutions, through our AWS segment, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings. 3Table of ContentsContent CreatorsWe serve authors and independent publishers with Kindle Direct Publishing, an online service that lets independent authors and publishers choose a royalty option and make their books available in the Kindle Store, along with Amazon’s own publishing arm, Amazon Publishing. We also offer programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell content.CompetitionOur businesses encompass a large variety of product types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The worldwide marketplace in which we compete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world. Our current and potential competitors include: (1)\\xa0physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer and sell to consumers and businesses; (2)\\xa0publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and all distribution channels; (3)\\xa0web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4)\\xa0companies that provide e-commerce services, including website development and hosting, omnichannel sales, inventory, and supply chain management, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment processing; (5)\\xa0companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-based infrastructure and other services; (7)\\xa0companies that design, manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, telecommunication, and electronic devices; and (8) companies that sell grocery products online and in physical stores. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers’ ability and willingness to change business practices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive terms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser-known businesses to compete against us. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.Intellectual PropertyWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties.SeasonalityOur business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December\\xa031. We recognized 34%, 31%, and 31% of our annual revenue during the fourth quarter of 2017, 2018, and 2019. Fourth quarter 2017 results include revenue attributable to Whole Foods Market, which we acquired on August 28, 2017.EmployeesWe employed approximately 798,000 full-time and part-time employees as of December\\xa031, 2019. However, employment levels fluctuate due to seasonal factors affecting our business. Additionally, we utilize independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. We have works councils, statutory employee representation obligations, and union agreements in certain countries outside the United States and at certain of our studio operations within the United States. We consider our employee relations to be good. Competition for qualified personnel has historically been intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff.4Table of ContentsAvailable InformationOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us.

Weeks\\xa060\\xa0Chief Executive Officer, Corning Incorporated5Table of ContentsItem\\xa01A.Risk FactorsPlease carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results), cash flows, liquidity, and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. In addition, the global economic climate amplifies many of these risks.We Face Intense CompetitionOur businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies, including cross-border competition, and in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-commerce services, web and infrastructure computing services, electronic devices, digital content, advertising, grocery, and transportation and logistics services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer geographic regions. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.Competition continues to intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electronic devices continue to increase our competition. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser known businesses to compete against us. As a result of competition, our product and service offerings may not be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose business, and we may be required to increase our spending or lower prices, any of which could materially reduce our sales and profits.Our Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other ResourcesWe are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to support our retail and services businesses. The complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions, and our expansion increases these factors. Failure to manage growth effectively could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.Our Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional RisksWe may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings. These offerings, which can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may not meet our expectations, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off.We Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth RateWe are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected.Our revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. A softening of demand, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decreased revenue or growth.Our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to factors described elsewhere in this section and the following:•our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers’ demands;6Table of Contents•our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers;•our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders;•the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements;•changes in usage or adoption rates of the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web services, including outside the U.S.;•timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure;•the success of our geographic, service, and product line expansions;•the extent to which we finance, and the terms of any such financing for, our current operations and future growth;•the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results;•variations in the mix of products and services we sell;•variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns;•the extent to which we offer fast and free delivery, continue to reduce prices worldwide, and provide additional benefits to our customers;•factors affecting our reputation or brand image;•the extent to which we invest in technology and content, fulfillment, and other expense categories;•increases in the prices of fuel and gasoline, as well as increases in the prices of other energy products and commodities like paper and packing supplies and hardware products;•the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services;•our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due;•the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware, viruses, phishing and other spam emails, denial of service attacks, data theft, computer intrusions, outages, and similar events; and•disruptions from natural or man-made disasters, extreme weather, geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities), labor or trade disputes, and similar events.Our International Operations Expose Us to a Number of RisksOur international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In certain international market segments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations and stores, and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not become profitable on a sustained basis.In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:•local economic and political conditions;•government regulation (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs); nationalization; and restrictions on foreign ownership;•restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, including uncertainty as a result of less Internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights;•business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices;•limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;•limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure;•shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow;•laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, privacy, network security, encryption, payments, advertising, and restrictions on pricing or discounts;7Table of Contents•lower levels of use of the Internet;•lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.;•lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk;•difficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;•different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions;•compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties;•laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and•geopolitical events, including war and terrorism.As international physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail and other services grow, competition will intensify, including through adoption of evolving business models. Local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, as well as their more established local brand names. The inability to hire, train, retain, and manage sufficient required personnel may limit our international growth.The People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and India regulate Amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that may restrict (i)\\xa0foreign investment in and operation of the Internet, IT infrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii)\\xa0Internet content, and (iii)\\xa0the sale of media and other products and services. For example, in order to meet local ownership, regulatory licensing, and cybersecurity requirements, we provide certain technology services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multi-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third-party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold indirect minority interests in entities that are third-party sellers on the www.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC and India may from time to time consider and implement additional changes in their regulatory, licensing, or other requirements that could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition, our Chinese and Indian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or, in China, enforce contractual relationships we or our affiliates have in place. Violation of any existing or future PRC, Indian, or other laws or regulations or changes in the interpretations of those laws and regulations could result in our businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other financial penalties, having licenses revoked, or being forced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely. We Face Risks Related to Successfully Optimizing and Operating Our Fulfillment Network and Data CentersFailures to adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully from time to time result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity, increased costs, and impairment charges, any of which could materially harm our business. As we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively.In addition, failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network increases our net shipping cost by requiring long-zone or partial shipments. We and our co-sourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers. Under some of our commercial agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network. Our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services to accurately forecast product demand may result in us being unable to secure sufficient storage space or to optimize our fulfillment network or cause other unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation.We rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. The inability to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or performance problems or other difficulties experienced by these companies or by our own transportation systems could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience. In addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by natural or man-made disasters, extreme weather, geopolitical events and security issues, labor or trade disputes, and similar events.8Table of ContentsThe Seasonality of Our Retail Business Places Increased Strain on Our OperationsWe expect a disproportionate amount of our retail sales to occur during our fourth quarter. Our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. When we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could materially reduce profitability. We regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. In addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service co-sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. Risks described elsewhere in this Item\\xa01A relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory are magnified during periods of high demand.We generally have payment terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customers. As a result of holiday sales, as of December\\xa031 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level (other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities). This operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of December\\xa031. Our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year, resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances.Our Commercial Agreements, Strategic Alliances, and Other Business Relationships Expose Us to RisksWe provide physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail and other services to businesses through commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships. Under these agreements, we provide web services, technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our stores. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other resource commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop the components of these commercial relationships, which may include web services, fulfillment, customer service, inventory management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware, content, and third-party software, and engaging third parties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales. Therefore, when the other company’s offerings are not successful, the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to enter into additional or alternative commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms. We also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, or developing these services.As our agreements terminate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operating results.Our present and future e-commerce services agreements, other commercial agreements, and strategic alliances create additional risks such as:•disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;•impairment of other relationships;•variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and•difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements.Our Business Suffers When We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Acquisitions and InvestmentsWe have acquired and invested in a number of companies, and we may in the future acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies. These transactions create risks such as:•disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;•problems retaining key personnel;•additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested;•the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including as a result of acquisitions;9Table of Contents•the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result of any integration of operations;•the difficulty of completing such transactions and achieving anticipated benefits within expected timeframes, or at all; •the difficulty of incorporating acquired operations, technology, and rights into our offerings, and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;•the difficulty of integrating a new company’s accounting, financial reporting, management, information and information security, human resource, and other administrative systems to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not successfully implemented;•losses we may incur as a result of declines in the value of an investment or as a result of incorporating an investee’s financial performance into our financial results;•for investments in which an investee’s financial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either in full or in part, the dependence on the investee’s accounting, financial reporting, and similar systems, controls, and processes;•the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger public company;•the risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face;•potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest; and•for foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.As a result of future acquisitions or mergers, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms, if at all. In addition, valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly. We could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or other-than-temporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results.We Have Foreign Exchange RiskThe results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international stores and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Due to these fluctuations, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. We also hold cash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies including British Pounds, Euros, and Japanese Yen. When the U.S.\\xa0Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may be materially less than expected and vice versa.The Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel or the Failure to Hire and Retain Highly Skilled and Other Key Personnel Could Negatively Affect Our BusinessWe depend on our senior management and other key personnel, particularly Jeffrey P. Bezos, our President, CEO, and Chairman. We do not have “key person” life insurance policies. We also rely on other highly skilled personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the technology industry has historically been intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees or the inability to hire, train, retain, and manage qualified personnel, could harm our business.We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security BreachesBecause we collect, process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including confidential, sensitive, proprietary, and business and personal information, failure to prevent or mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, or other security breaches or vulnerabilities affecting our or our vendors’ or customers’ technology, products, and systems, could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss, disclosure, or misuse of such information, adversely affect our operating results, result in litigation, regulatory action (including under privacy or data protection laws), and potential liability for us, deter customers or sellers from using our stores and services, and otherwise harm our business and reputation. We use third-party technology and systems for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. Some of our systems have experienced past security breaches, and, 10Table of Contentsalthough they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent such incidents, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor or customer, such measures cannot provide absolute security and may fail to operate as intended or be circumvented.We Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of RedundancyWe experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently accepting or fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties, which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services. Steps we take to add software and hardware, upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and improve the stability and efficiency of our systems may not be sufficient to avoid system interruptions or delays that could adversely affect our operating results.Our computer and communications systems and operations in the past have been, or in the future could be, damaged or interrupted due to events such as natural or man-made disasters, extreme weather, geopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities), computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability. Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient. In addition, our insurance may not provide sufficient coverage to compensate for related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy.We Face Significant Inventory RiskIn addition to risks described elsewhere in this Item\\xa01A relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties, we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles and pricing, defective merchandise, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products, spoilage, and other factors. We endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell. Demand for products, however, can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. In addition, when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components requires significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. We carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products, such as consumer electronics, and at times we are unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or to meet demand during the relevant selling seasons. Any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results.We Face Risks Related to Adequately Protecting Our Intellectual Property Rights and Being Accused of Infringing Intellectual Property Rights of Third PartiesWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, and others to protect our proprietary rights. Effective intellectual property protection is not available in every country in which our products and services are made available. We also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business. Furthermore, regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.We are not always able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Actions taken by third parties that license our proprietary rights may materially diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. The protection of our intellectual property requires the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights.We have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, have in the past, and may in the future, result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us, or significant payments for damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations or to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights. Such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims.11Table of ContentsOur digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content. Breach or malfunctioning of the digital rights management technology that we use could subject us to claims, and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service.We Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highly VolatileWe have a rapidly evolving business model. The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to, among other risks, the risks described elsewhere in this Item\\xa01A, as well as:•changes in interest rates;•conditions or trends in the Internet and the industry segments we operate in;•quarterly variations in operating results;•fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for Internet-related companies in particular;•changes in financial estimates by us or decisions to increase or decrease future spending or investment levels; •changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;•changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;•changes in the valuation methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and•transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, and speculation.Volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically, which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders, or both.Government Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our BusinessWe are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, digital content, web services, electronic devices, artificial intelligence technologies and services, and other products and services that we offer or sell. These regulations and laws cover taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, transportation, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy consumption, environmental regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, consumer protection, employment, trade and protectionist measures, web services, the provision of online payment services, registration, licensing, and information reporting requirements, unencumbered Internet access to our services or access to our facilities, the design and operation of websites, health, safety, and sanitation standards, the characteristics, legality, and quality of products and services, product labeling, the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems, and other matters. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, data protection, and personal privacy apply to aspects of our operations such as the Internet, e-commerce, digital content, web services, electronic devices, and artificial intelligence technologies and services. A large number of jurisdictions regulate our operations, and the extent, nature, and scope of such regulations is evolving and expanding as the scope of our businesses expand. We are regularly subject to formal and informal reviews and investigations by governments and regulatory authorities under existing laws, regulations, or interpretations or pursuing new and novel approaches to regulate our operations. For example, the European Commission announced that it has opened an investigation to assess whether aspects of our operations with marketplace sellers violate EU competition rules. Unfavorable regulations, laws, decisions, or interpretations by government or regulatory authorities applying those laws and regulations, or inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions threatened or initiated by them, could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary fines), diminish the demand for, or availability of, our products and services, increase our cost of doing business, require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, damage our reputation, impede our growth, or otherwise have a material effect on our operations.Claims, Litigation, Government Investigations, and Other Proceedings May Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of OperationsAs an innovative company offering a wide range of consumer and business products and services around the world, we are regularly subject to actual and threatened claims, litigation, reviews, investigations, and other proceedings, including proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities, involving a wide range of issues, including patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. The number and scale of these proceedings have increased over time as our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach and our products, services, and operations have become more complex and available to, and used by, more people. Any of these types of 12Table of Contentsproceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs, disruption of our operations, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, and other factors. The outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.\\xa0Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes. Until the final resolution of such matters, we may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings, including as a result of a settlement, could involve licenses, sanctions, consent decrees, or orders requiring us to make substantial future payments, preventing us from offering certain products or services, requiring us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies, damaging our reputation, or otherwise having a material effect on our operations. We Face Additional Tax Liabilities and Collection ObligationsWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. Such changes could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, targeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to collect sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations. For example, the European Union, certain member states, and other countries have proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues. Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely effected by additional taxes of this nature imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide information about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies. In some cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date.Our tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, and changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense and liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, the legislation known as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “U.S. Tax Act”) requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies will continue to interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the U.S. Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered. As future guidance is issued, we may make adjustments to amounts that we have previously recorded that may materially impact our financial statements in the period in which the adjustments are made.We are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax assessments against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical tax accruals.Our Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of RisksWe have significant suppliers, including content and technology licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of supply, that are important to our sourcing, services, manufacturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Decisions by our current suppliers to stop selling or licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural disasters, or for other reasons, may result in our being unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, violations by our suppliers or other vendors of applicable laws, regulations, contractual 13Table of Contentsterms, intellectual property rights of others, or our Supply Chain Standards, as well as products or practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous, could expose us to claims, damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.We Are Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts and Related Procurement RegulationsOur contracts with U.S., as well as state, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration, and performance. We are subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, some of these contracts provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause.We Are Subject to Product Liability Claims When People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell or ManufactureSome of the products we sell or manufacture expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness, death, or environmental or property damage, and can require product recalls or other actions. Third parties who sell products using our services and stores increase our exposure to product liability claims, such as when these sellers do not have sufficient protection from such claims. Although we maintain liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of products, we may not be able to detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for breaches of such agreements. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability.We Are Subject to Payments-Related RisksWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, credit accounts (including promotional financing), gift cards, direct debit from a customer’s bank account, consumer invoicing, physical bank check, and payment upon delivery. For existing and future payment options we offer to our customers, we currently are subject to, and may become subject to additional, regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide certain Amazon-branded payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and promotional financing. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We also offer co-branded credit card programs, which could adversely affect our operating results if renewed on less favorable terms or terminated. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. Failure to comply with these rules or requirements, as well as any breach, compromise, or failure to otherwise detect or prevent fraudulent activity involving our data security systems, could result in our being liable for card issuing banks’ costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.In addition, we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties, and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf. Jurisdictions subject us to requirements for licensing, regulatory inspection, bonding and capital maintenance, the use, handling, and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, maintaining or processing data, and authentication. We are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money laundering, international money transfers, privacy and information security, and electronic fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services.We Are Impacted by Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of SellersThe law relating to the liability of online service providers is currently unsettled. In addition, governmental agencies have in the past and could in the future require changes in the way this business is conducted. Under our seller programs, we maintain policies and processes designed to prevent sellers from collecting payments, fraudulently or otherwise, when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions, and to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods, selling 14Table of Contentsgoods in an unlawful or unethical manner, violating the proprietary rights of others, or otherwise violating our policies. When these policies and processes are circumvented or fail to operate sufficiently, it can harm our business or damage our reputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our sellers. Under our A2Z Guarantee, we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these situations, and as our third-party seller sales grow, the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results.

All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of claims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item\\xa01A of Part\\xa0I, “Risk Factors.”OverviewOur primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered through our stores include merchandise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices and produce media content. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous product categories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, advertising, publishing, and digital content subscriptions.Our financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows1. Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital2 and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives, including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, producing original content, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. We seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our online stores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment and delivery networks and related facilities. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture._______________________(1)See “Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures.(2)Working capital consists of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable.19Table of ContentsBecause of our model we are able to turn our inventory quickly and have a cash-generating operating cycle3. On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers.We expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, the advances of wireless connectivity, and the practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. We are also investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings to developers and enterprises of all sizes.We seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns\\xa0the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 507 million and 512 million as of December\\xa031, 2018 and 2019.Our financial reporting currency is the U.S.\\xa0Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends. For example, if the U.S.\\xa0Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S.\\xa0Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes.In addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons.For additional information about each line item addressed above, refer to Item\\xa08 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies.”Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December\\xa031, 2018 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December\\xa031, 2017 in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”_______________________(3)The operating cycle is the number of days of sales in inventory plus the number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days.20Table of ContentsCritical Accounting JudgmentsThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s\\xa0financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item\\xa08 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.InventoriesInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December\\xa031, 2019, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $230 million.In addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In addition, a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as the U.S. tax reform legislation commonly known as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “U.S. Tax Act”). Finally, foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the U.S. Tax Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.The U.S. Tax Act significantly changed how the U.S. taxes corporations. The U.S. Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies will continue to interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the U.S. Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered. As future guidance is issued, we may make adjustments to amounts that we have previously recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made. We are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.21Table of ContentsRecent Accounting PronouncementsSee Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies.”Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash flow information, which reflects retrospective adjustments to our consolidated statements of cash flows as described in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies,” is as follows (in millions):\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Year Ended December 31,\\xa02018\\xa02019Cash provided by (used in):\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Operating activities$30,723\\xa0$38,514Investing activities(12,369)\\xa0(24,281)Financing activities(7,686)\\xa0(10,066)Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $41.3 billion and $55.0 billion as of December\\xa031, 2018 and 2019. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $13.8 billion and $15.3 billion as of December\\xa031, 2018 and 2019, and were primarily Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen.Cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $30.7 billion and $38.5 billion in 2018 and 2019. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term obligations. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. The increase in operating cash flow in 2019, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. Cash provided by (used in) operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received from property and equipment vendors, proceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(12.4) billion and $(24.3) billion in 2018 and 2019, with the variability caused primarily by our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment and purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities. Cash capital expenditures were $11.3 billion, and $12.7 billion in 2018 and 2019, which primarily reflect additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations and additional investments in support of continued business growth in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS). We made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $2.2 billion and $2.5 billion in 2018 and 2019.Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(7.7) billion and $(10.1) billion in 2018 and 2019. Cash outflows from financing activities result from principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations and repayments of long-term debt and other, and were $8.5 billion and $12.3 billion in 2018 and 2019. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $10.6 billion and $13.7 billion in 2018 and 2019, with the increase reflecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS, which investments we expect to continue over time.We had no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program (the “Commercial Paper Program”) or unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Agreement”) and $740 million of borrowings outstanding under our $740 million secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) as of December\\xa031, 2019. See Item\\xa08 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6 — Debt” for additional information.\\xa0In 2018 and 2019, we recorded net tax provisions of $1.2 billion and $2.4 billion. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings are subject to U.S. taxation under the U.S. Tax Act, which also repeals U.S. taxation on the subsequent repatriation of those earnings. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign 22Table of Contentssubsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. As of December\\xa031, 2019, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $13.4 billion.Tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our U.S. taxable income. The U.S. Tax Act enhanced and extended accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $1.2 billion and $881 million for 2018 and 2019. As of December\\xa031, 2019, we had approximately $1.7 billion of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit. As we utilize our federal tax credits we expect cash paid for taxes to increase. We endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis. In connection with the European Commission’s October 2017 decision against us on state aid, Luxembourg tax authorities computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission’s decision, of approximately €250 million, that we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. Our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for real estate leases, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit. To the extent we process payments for third-party sellers or offer certain types of stored value to our customers, some jurisdictions may restrict our use of those funds. These restrictions would result in the reclassification of a portion of our cash and cash equivalents from “Cash and cash equivalents” to restricted cash, which is classified within “Accounts receivable, net and other” and “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December\\xa031, 2018 and 2019, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $426 million and $321 million. See Item\\xa08 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 7 — Commitments and Contingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, purchase obligations and open purchase orders, consisting of inventory and significant non-inventory commitments, were $15.7 billion as of December\\xa031, 2019. These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item\\xa01A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.23Table of ContentsResults of OperationsWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 10 — Segment Information.” Net SalesNet sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Service sales primarily represent third-party seller fees, which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees, AWS sales, Amazon Prime membership fees, advertising services, and certain digital content subscriptions. Net sales information is as follows (in millions):\\xa0\\xa0Year Ended December 31,\\xa02018\\xa02019Net Sales:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0North America$141,366\\xa0$170,773International65,866\\xa074,723AWS25,655\\xa035,026Consolidated$232,887\\xa0$280,522Year-over-year Percentage Growth:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0North America33%\\xa021%International21\\xa013AWS47\\xa037Consolidated31\\xa020Year-over-year Percentage Growth, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0North America33%\\xa021%International19\\xa017AWS47\\xa037Consolidated30\\xa022Net sales mix:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0North America61%\\xa061%International28\\xa027AWS11\\xa012Consolidated100%\\xa0100%Sales increased 20% in 2019, compared to the prior year. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted net sales by $1.3 billion and $(2.6) billion for 2018 and 2019. For a discussion of the effect on sales growth of foreign exchange rates, see “Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” below.North America sales increased 21% in 2019, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection.International sales increased 13% in 2019, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, increased in-stock inventory availability, and increased selection. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted International net sales by $1.3 billion and $(2.4) billion in 2018 and 2019. AWS sales increased 37% in 2019, compared to the prior year. The sales growth primarily reflects increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes. Pricing changes were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers.\\xa024Table of ContentsOperating Income (Loss) Operating income (loss) by segment is as follows (in millions):\\xa0Year Ended December 31,\\xa02018\\xa02019Operating Income (Loss):\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0North America$7,267\\xa0$7,033International(2,142)\\xa0(1,693)AWS7,296\\xa09,201Consolidated$12,421$14,541Operating income was $12.4 billion and $14.5 billion for 2018 and 2019. We believe that operating income (loss) is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services.The decrease in North America operating income in absolute dollars in 2019, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased shipping costs and marketing expense, partially offset by increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales and slower growth in certain operating expenses. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $17 million and $23 million for 2018 and 2019. The decrease in International operating loss in absolute dollars in 2019, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales, and slower growth in certain operating expenses, partially offset by increased marketing expense. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating loss by $258 million and $(116) million for 2018 and 2019. The increase in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in 2019, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure productivity, partially offset by pricing changes and increased spending on technology infrastructure and payroll and related expenses, which was primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $(49) million and $273 million for 2018 and 2019.25Table of ContentsOperating ExpensesInformation about operating expenses is as follows (in millions):\\xa0\\xa0Year Ended December 31,\\xa0\\xa02018\\xa02019Operating expenses:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Cost of sales$139,156\\xa0$165,536Fulfillment34,027\\xa040,232Technology and content28,837\\xa035,931Marketing13,814\\xa018,878General and administrative4,336\\xa05,203Other operating expense (income), net296\\xa0201Total operating expenses$220,466$265,981Year-over-year Percentage Growth:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Cost of sales24%\\xa019\\xa0%Fulfillment35\\xa018Technology and content27\\xa025Marketing37\\xa037General and administrative18\\xa020Other operating expense (income), net38\\xa0(32)Percent of Net Sales:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Cost of sales59.8%\\xa059.0\\xa0%Fulfillment14.6\\xa014.3Technology and content12.4\\xa012.8Marketing5.9\\xa06.7General and administrative1.9\\xa01.9Other operating expense (income), net0.1\\xa00.1Cost of SalesCost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music.The increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2019, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales.Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Shipping costs, which include sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs, were $27.7 billion and $37.9 billion in 2018 and 2019. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we reduce shipping rates, we use more expensive shipping methods, including faster delivery, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.Costs to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as “Technology and content” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers.26Table of ContentsFulfillmentFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in fulfillment, AWS costs are primarily classified as “Technology and content.” Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent to which third party sellers utilize Fulfillment by Amazon services, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, because payment processing costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing costs as a percent of net sales.The increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2019, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels and costs from expanding our fulfillment network, which includes physical stores.We seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.Technology and ContentTechnology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers.We seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2019, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to an increase in spending on technology infrastructure and increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings. We expect technology and content costs to grow at a slower rate in 2020 due to an increase in the estimated useful life of our servers, which will impact each of our segments. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies — Use of Estimates” for additional information on the change in estimated useful life of our servers.MarketingMarketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, third party customer referrals, social and online advertising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs.The increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in 2019, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased spending on marketing channels, as well as payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities.While costs associated with Amazon Prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.27Table of ContentsGeneral and AdministrativeThe increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2019, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses.Other Operating Expense (Income), NetOther operating expense (income), net was $296 million and $201 million during 2018 and 2019, and is primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets.Interest Income and ExpenseOur interest income was $440 million and $832 million during 2018 and 2019. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested.Interest expense was $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion in 2018 and 2019. The increase is primarily related to finance leases.Our long-term lease liabilities were $9.7 billion and $39.8 billion as of December\\xa031, 2018 and 2019. Our long-term debt was $23.5 billion and $23.4 billion as of December\\xa031, 2018 and 2019.  See Item\\xa08 of Part\\xa0II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 4 — Leases and Note 6 — Debt” for additional information.Other Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net was $(183) million and $203 million during 2018 and 2019. The primary components of other income (expense), net are related to equity securities and warrant valuations and foreign currency.Income TaxesOur effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, audit-related developments, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. We recorded a provision for income taxes of $1.2 billion and $2.4 billion in 2018 and 2019. Our provision for income taxes in 2019 was higher than in 2018 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income, a decline in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and the one-time provisional tax benefit of the U.S. Tax Act recognized in 2018.Tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our U.S. taxable income. The U.S. Tax Act enhanced and extended accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. As of December\\xa031, 2019, we had approximately $1.7 billion of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit.See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 9 — Income Taxes” for additional information.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresRegulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures. We provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through finance leases and financing obligations. We adopted new lease accounting guidance on January 1, 2019 without retrospectively adjusting prior periods. As a result, the line items used in our calculation of measures of free cash flows have changed. See Item\\xa08 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies.”28Table of ContentsFree Cash FlowFree cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives.” The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2018 and 2019 (in millions):\\xa0Year Ended December 31,\\xa02018\\xa02019Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$30,723\\xa0$38,514Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives(11,323)\\xa0(12,689)Free cash flow$19,400$25,825\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(12,369)\\xa0$(24,281)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$(7,686)\\xa0$(10,066)Free Cash Flow Less Principal Repayments of Finance Leases and Financing ObligationsFree cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of finance leases” and “Principal repayments of financing obligations.” Principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations approximates the actual payments of cash for our finance leases and financing obligations. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2018 and 2019 (in millions):\\xa0Year Ended December 31,\\xa02018\\xa02019Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$30,723\\xa0$38,514Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives(11,323)\\xa0(12,689)Free cash flow19,400\\xa025,825Principal repayments of finance leases (1)(7,449)\\xa0(9,628)Principal repayments of financing obligations (1)(337)\\xa0(27)Free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations$11,614\\xa0$16,170\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(12,369)\\xa0$(24,281)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$(7,686)\\xa0$(10,066)_______________(1) Amounts for 2018 have not been retrospectively adjusted.29Table of ContentsFree Cash Flow Less Equipment Finance Leases and Principal Repayments of All Other Finance Leases and Financing Obligations Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations is free cash flow reduced by equipment acquired under finance leases, which is included in “Property and equipment acquired under finance leases,” principal repayments of all other finance lease liabilities, which is included in “Principal repayments of finance leases,” and “Principal repayments of financing obligations.”\\xa0All other finance lease liabilities and financing obligations consists of property. In this measure, equipment acquired under finance leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been leased. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for 2018 and 2019 (in millions):\\xa0Year Ended December 31,\\xa02018\\xa02019Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$30,723\\xa0$38,514Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives(11,323)\\xa0(12,689)Free cash flow19,400\\xa025,825Equipment acquired under finance leases (1)(10,615)\\xa0(12,916)Principal repayments of all other finance leases (2)—\\xa0(392)Principal repayments of financing obligations(337)\\xa0(27)Free cash flow less equipment finance leases and principal repayments of all other finance leases and financing obligations$8,448\\xa0$12,490\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(12,369)\\xa0$(24,281)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$(7,686)\\xa0$(10,066)___________________(1)For the twelve months ended December\\xa031, 2019, this amount relates to equipment included in “Property and equipment acquired under finance leases” of $13,723 million.

Amounts for 2018 have not been retrospectively adjusted.All of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.30Table of ContentsEffect of Foreign Exchange RatesInformation regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S.\\xa0Dollar, on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year periods.

These forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of January\\xa030, 2020, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, as well as those outlined in Item\\xa01A of Part I, “Risk Factors.”First Quarter 2020 Guidance•Net sales are expected to be between $69.0 billion and $73.0 billion, or to grow between 16% and 22% compared with first quarter 2019. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 5 basis points from foreign exchange rates. •Operating income is expected to be between $3.0 billion and $4.2 billion, compared with $4.4 billion in first quarter 2019. This guidance includes approximately $800 million lower depreciation expense due to an increase in the estimated useful life of our servers beginning on January 1, 2020. •This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.31Table of Contents\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Item\\xa07A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item\\xa07 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.”Interest Rate RiskOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long-term debt. Our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.The following table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted-average interest rates as of December\\xa031, 2019 (in millions, except percentages):\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02020\\xa02021\\xa02022\\xa02023\\xa02024\\xa0Thereafter\\xa0Total\\xa0Estimated Fair Value as of December 31, 2019Money market funds\\xa0$18,850\\xa0$—\\xa0$—\\xa0$—\\xa0$—\\xa0$—\\xa0$18,850\\xa0$18,850Weighted average interest rate\\xa01.09%\\xa0—%\\xa0—%\\xa0—%\\xa0—%\\xa0—%\\xa01.09%\\xa0\\xa0Corporate debt securities\\xa07,629\\xa02,988\\xa01,052\\xa0152\\xa08\\xa0—\\xa011,829\\xa011,881Weighted average interest rate\\xa02.29%\\xa02.63%\\xa02.57%\\xa02.38%\\xa02.90%\\xa0—%\\xa02.41%\\xa0\\xa0U.S. government and agency securities\\xa04,893\\xa01,634\\xa0486\\xa043\\xa016\\xa0—\\xa07,072\\xa07,080Weighted average interest rate\\xa01.64%\\xa02.09%\\xa02.01%\\xa02.29%\\xa02.03%\\xa0—%\\xa01.77%\\xa0\\xa0Asset-backed securities\\xa01,492\\xa0546\\xa0180\\xa095\\xa038\\xa0—\\xa02,351\\xa02,360Weighted average interest rate\\xa02.57%\\xa02.52%\\xa02.53%\\xa02.29%\\xa02.52%\\xa0—%\\xa02.54%\\xa0\\xa0Foreign government and agency securities\\xa04,630\\xa0168\\xa04\\xa0—\\xa02\\xa0—\\xa04,804\\xa04,794Weighted average interest rate\\xa01.90%\\xa02.57%\\xa02.08%\\xa0—%\\xa02.30%\\xa0—%\\xa01.92%\\xa0\\xa0Other fixed income securities\\xa093\\xa094\\xa0129\\xa075\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0391\\xa0394Weighted average interest rate\\xa02.39%\\xa02.32%\\xa02.10%\\xa01.92%\\xa0—%\\xa0—%\\xa02.19%\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$37,587\\xa0$5,430\\xa0$1,851\\xa0$365\\xa0$64\\xa0$—\\xa0$45,297\\xa0\\xa0Cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$45,35932Table of ContentsAs of December\\xa031, 2019, we had $24.8 billion of debt, including the current portion, primarily consisting of the following fixed rate unsecured debt (in millions):1.900% Notes due on August 21, 2020$1,0003.300% Notes due on December 5, 2021$1,0002.500% Notes due on November\\xa029, 2022$1,2502.400% Notes due on February 22, 2023$1,0002.800% Notes due on August 22, 2024$2,0003.800% Notes due on December 5, 2024$1,2505.200% Notes due on December 3, 2025$1,0003.150% Notes due on August 22, 2027$3,5004.800% Notes due on December 5, 2034$1,2503.875% Notes due on August 22, 2037$2,7504.950% Notes due on December 5, 2044$1,5004.050% Notes due on August 22, 2047$3,5004.250% Notes due on August 22, 2057$2,250Based upon quoted market prices and Level 2 inputs, the fair value of our total debt was $27.8 billion as of December\\xa031, 2019.Foreign Exchange RiskDuring 2019, net sales from our International segment accounted for 27% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales decreased by $2.4 billion in comparison with the prior year.We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December\\xa031, 2019, of $15.3 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of $765 million, $1.5 billion, and $3.1 billion. Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income.We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of December\\xa031, 2019, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of $195 million, $385 million, and $775 million, recorded to “Other income (expense), net.”See Item\\xa07 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.Equity Investment RiskAs of December\\xa031, 2019, our recorded value in equity and equity warrant investments in public and private companies was $3.3 billion. Our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies represent $679 million of our investments as of December\\xa031, 2019, and are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. We perform a qualitative assessment for our equity investments in private companies to identify impairment. If this assessment indicates that an impairment exists, we estimate the fair value of the investment and, if the fair value is less than carrying value, we write down the investment to fair value. Our assessment includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. The current global economic climate provides additional uncertainty. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.33Table of ContentsItem\\xa08.Financial Statements and Supplementary DataINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\xa0\\xa0PageReport of Ernst\\xa0& Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm35Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows37Consolidated Statements of Operations38Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income39Consolidated Balance Sheets40Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity41Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements4234Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and ShareholdersAmazon.com, Inc.Opinion on the Financial StatementsWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) as of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December\\xa031, 2019 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December\\xa031, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December\\xa031, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated January\\xa030, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Adoption of New Accounting StandardAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method for accounting for leases in 2019 due to the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).Basis for OpinionThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit MatterThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Uncertain Tax PositionsDescription of the MatterThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions and, as discussed in Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements, during the ordinary course of business, there are many tax positions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company’s tax positions and determining its provision for income taxes. The Company uses significant judgment in (1) determining whether a tax position’s technical merits are more likely than not to be sustained and (2) measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. As of December 31, 2019, the Company accrued liabilities of $3.9 billion for various tax contingencies.Auditing the measurement of the Company’s tax contingencies was challenging because the evaluation of whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.35Table of ContentsHow We Addressed the Matter in Our AuditWe tested controls over the Company’s process to assess the technical merits of its tax contingencies, including controls over the assessment as to whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, management’s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions, and the development of the related disclosures. We involved our international tax, transfer pricing, and research and development tax professionals in assessing the technical merits of certain of the Company’s tax positions. Depending on the nature of the specific tax position and, as applicable, developments with the relevant tax authorities relating thereto, our procedures included obtaining and examining the Company’s analysis including the Company’s correspondence with such tax authorities and evaluating the underlying facts upon which the tax positions are based. We used our knowledge of, and experience with, international, transfer pricing, and other income tax laws by the relevant income tax authorities to evaluate the Company’s accounting for its tax contingencies. We evaluated developments in the applicable regulatory environments to assess potential effects on the Company’s positions. We analyzed the Company’s assumptions and data used to determine the amount of tax benefits to recognize and tested the accuracy of the Company’s calculations. We have also evaluated the Company’s income tax disclosures included in Note 9 in relation to these matters./s/ Ernst & Young LLPWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1996.

STATEMENTSNote 1 — DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND ACCOUNTING POLICIESDescription of BusinessWe seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. We serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores and fulfill orders through us, and programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell content. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through our AWS segment, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices. In addition, we provide services, such as advertising to sellers, vendors, publishers, and authors, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising.We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. See “Note\\xa010 — Segment Information.” Prior Period Reclassifications Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation, including the addition of restricted cash to cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated statements of cash flows and the reclassification of long-term capital lease obligations that existed at December\\xa031, 2018 from “Other long-term liabilities” to “Long-term lease liabilities” within the consolidated balance sheets, as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance. See “Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted.”Principles of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities (collectively, the “Company”), consisting of its wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in India and certain entities that support our seller lending financing activities. Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated. The financial results of Whole Foods Market, Inc. (“Whole Foods Market”) have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition on August 28, 2017.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, and inventory valuation. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. For example, in Q4 2019 we completed a useful life study for our servers and are increasing the useful life from three years to four years for servers in January 2020, which, based on servers that are included in “Property and equipment, net” as of December 31, 2019, will have an anticipated impact to our 2020 operating income of $2.3 billion.Earnings per ShareBasic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a net loss, stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect.42Table of ContentsThe following table shows the calculation of diluted shares (in millions):\\xa0\\xa0Year Ended December 31,\\xa02017\\xa02018\\xa02019Shares used in computation of basic earnings per share480\\xa0487\\xa0494Total dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards13\\xa013\\xa010Shares used in computation of diluted earnings per share493\\xa0500\\xa0504RevenueRevenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return allowances, promotional discounts, and rebates. Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determine stand-alone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin. A description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows:Retail sales - We offer consumer products through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.Third-party seller services - We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. The commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services are rendered, which generally occurs upon delivery of the related products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer. Subscription services - Our subscription sales include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to content including audiobooks, digital video, digital music, e-books, and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime memberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single stand-ready obligation. Subscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized over the subscription period.AWS - Our AWS arrangements include global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is allocated to services using stand-alone selling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services, based on the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Certain services, including compute and database, are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized ratably. Sales commissions we pay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term.Other - Other revenue primarily includes sales of advertising services, which are recognized as ads are delivered based on the number of clicks or impressions. Return Allowances Return allowances, which reduce revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Liabilities for return allowances are included in “Accrued expenses and other” and were $468 million, $623 million, and $712 million as of December\\xa031, 2017, 2018, and 2019. Additions to the allowance were $1.8 billion, $2.3 billion, and $2.5 billion and deductions from the allowance were $1.9 billion, $2.3 billion, and $2.5 billion in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Included in “Inventories” on our consolidated balance sheets are assets totaling $406 million, $519 million, and $629 million as of December\\xa031, 2017, 2018, and 2019, for the rights to recover products from customers associated with our liabilities for return allowances. Cost of SalesCost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and delivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. Payment processing and related transaction costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in “Fulfillment” on our consolidated statements of operations.43Table of ContentsVendor AgreementsWe have agreements with our vendors to receive funds primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, incentives, and volume rebates.\\xa0We generally consider these amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typically depend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates can be reasonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold.FulfillmentFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International segments’ fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers, including costs attributable to buying, receiving, inspecting, and warehousing inventories; picking, packaging, and preparing customer orders for shipment; payment processing and related transaction costs, including costs associated with our guarantee for certain seller transactions; responding to inquiries from customers; and supply chain management for our manufactured electronic devices. Fulfillment costs also include amounts paid to third parties that assist us in fulfillment and customer service operations.Technology and ContentTechnology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers. Technology and content costs are generally expensed as incurred.MarketingMarketing costs primarily consist of advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales commissions related to AWS. We pay commissions to third parties when their customer referrals result in sales. We also participate in cooperative advertising arrangements with certain of our vendors, and other third parties.Advertising and other promotional costs to market our products and services are expensed as incurred and were $6.3 billion, $8.2 billion, and $11.0 billion in 2017, 2018, and 2019. General and AdministrativeGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs for corporate functions, including payroll and related expenses; facilities and equipment expenses, such as depreciation and amortization expense and rent; and professional fees and litigation costs.Stock-Based CompensationCompensation cost for all stock awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service period. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including historical forfeiture experience and employee level.Other Operating Expense (Income), NetOther operating expense (income), net, consists primarily of marketing-related, contract-based, and customer-related intangible asset amortization expense, and expenses related to legal settlements.44Table of ContentsOther Income (Expense), NetOther income (expense), net, consists primarily of adjustments to and gains on equity securities of $18 million, $145 million, and $231 million in 2017, 2018, and 2019, equity warrant valuation gains (losses) of $109 million, $(131) million, and $11 million in 2017, 2018, and 2019, and foreign currency gains (losses) of $247 million, $(206) million, and $(20) million in 2017, 2018, and 2019.Income TaxesIncome tax expense includes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings are subject to U.S. taxation under the U.S. Tax Act, which also repeals U.S. taxation on the subsequent repatriation of those earnings. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.  Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.We utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\\xa0We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair value:Level\\xa01 — Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.Level\\xa02 — Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.Level\\xa03 — Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.For our cash, cash equivalents, or marketable securities, we measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, or marketable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December\\xa031, 2018 and 2019.We hold equity warrants giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of December\\xa031, 2018 and 2019, these warrants had a fair value of $440 million and $669 million, and are recorded within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. These assets are primarily classified as Level 2 assets. Cash and Cash EquivalentsWe classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.45Table of ContentsInventoriesInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. We provide Fulfillment by Amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers’ programs. Third-party sellers maintain ownership of their inventory, regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these products are not included in our inventories.We also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain electronic device components. A portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm, non-cancellable commitments. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. We also have firm, non-cancellable commitments for certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores. Accounts Receivable, Net and OtherIncluded in “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to customers, vendors, and sellers. As of December\\xa031, 2018 and 2019, customer receivables, net, were $9.4 billion and $12.6 billion, vendor receivables, net, were $3.2 billion and $4.2 billion, and seller receivables, net, were $710 million and $863 million. Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which provides funding to sellers primarily to procure inventory.We estimate losses on receivables based on known troubled accounts and historical experience of losses incurred. Receivables are considered impaired and written-off when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $348 million, $495 million, and $718 million as of December\\xa031, 2017, 2018, and 2019. Additions to the allowance were $626 million, $878 million, and $1.0 billion, and deductions to the allowance were $515 million, $731 million, and $793 million in 2017, 2018, and 2019.Software Development CostsWe incur software development costs related to products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, internal-use software, and our websites. Software development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented. All other costs, including those related to design or maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Property and Equipment, NetProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Incentives that we receive from property and equipment vendors are recorded as a reduction in our costs.\\xa0Property includes buildings and land that we own, along with property we have acquired under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period and finance lease arrangements. Equipment includes assets such as servers and networking equipment, heavy equipment, and other fulfillment equipment. Depreciation and amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets (generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, three years for our servers, five years for networking equipment, ten years for heavy equipment, and three to seven years for other fulfillment equipment). Depreciation and amortization expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations. LeasesWe categorize leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are generally those leases that allow us to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired under finance leases are recorded in property and equipment, net. All other leases are categorized as operating leases. Our leases generally have terms that range from one to ten years for equipment and one to twenty years for property.Certain lease contracts include obligations to pay for other services, such as operations and maintenance. For leases of property, we account for these other services as a component of the lease. For substantially all other leases, the services are accounted for separately and we allocate payments to the lease and other services components based on estimated stand-alone prices.46Table of ContentsLease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives using a discount rate based on similarly secured borrowings available to us. Lease assets are recognized based on the initial present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives, plus any direct costs from executing the leases or lease prepayments reclassified from “Other assets” upon lease commencement. Leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the lease term.When we have the option to extend the lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or purchase the leased asset, and it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option, we consider these options in determining the classification and measurement of the lease. Our leases may include variable payments based on measures that include changes in price indices, market interest rates, or the level of sales at a physical store, which are expensed as incurred. Costs associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease. Finance lease assets are amortized within operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or, in the instance where title does not transfer at the end of the lease term, the lease term. The interest component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term.We establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are depreciated over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.Financing ObligationsWe record assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period. If we continue to control the building after the construction period, the arrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a lease. The building is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life or the term of the obligation. If we do not control the building after the construction period ends, the assets and liabilities for construction costs are derecognized, and we classify the lease as either operating or finance. GoodwillWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. In testing goodwill for impairment, we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform a two-step impairment test. We test goodwill for impairment under the two-step impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions. We completed the required annual testing of goodwill for impairment for all reporting units as of April 1, 2019, and determined that goodwill is not impaired as the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their book value. There were no events that caused us to update our annual impairment test. See “Note\\xa05 — Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets.”Other AssetsIncluded in “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to acquired intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization; video and music content, net of accumulated amortization; long-term deferred tax assets; certain equity investments; marketable securities restricted for longer than one year, the majority of which are attributable to collateralization of bank guarantees and debt related to our international operations; lease prepayments made prior to lease commencement; and equity warrant assets.Digital Video and Music ContentWe obtain video content, inclusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as payments are made and we 47Table of Contentsamortize the asset to “Cost of sales” on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line basis. If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred. We also develop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to “Cost of sales” predominantly on an accelerated basis that follows the viewing patterns associated with the content. The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 2.7 years.Our produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each major geography where we offer Amazon Prime memberships. These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is less than the carrying value. The total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December\\xa031, 2018 and 2019 were $3.8 billion and $5.8 billion. Total video and music expense was $6.7 billion and $7.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2019. Total video and music expense includes licensing and production costs associated with content offered within Amazon Prime memberships, and costs associated with digital subscriptions and sold or rented content.InvestmentsWe generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Such investments are included in “Cash and cash equivalents” or “Marketable securities” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).”Equity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Equity-method investments are included within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. Our share of the earnings or losses as reported by equity-method investees, amortization of basis differences, and related gains or losses, if any, are classified as “Equity-method investment activity, net of tax” on our consolidated statements of operations. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for at cost with adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments and are classified as “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets with adjustments recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. As of December\\xa031, 2018 and 2019, these investments had a carrying value of $282 million and $1.5 billion.Equity investments that have readily determinable fair values are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with changes recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statement of operations. We periodically evaluate whether declines in fair values of our investments indicate impairment. For debt securities and equity-method investments, we also evaluate whether declines in fair value of our investments below their book value are other-than-temporary. This evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs. Additionally, we assess whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell any investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Factors considered include: quoted market prices; recent financial results and operating trends; implied values from any recent transactions or offers of investee securities; credit quality of debt instrument issuers; other publicly available information that may affect the value of our investments; duration and severity of the decline in value; and our strategy and intentions for holding the investment.Long-Lived AssetsLong-lived assets, other than goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable.For long-lived assets used in operations, including lease assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. Long-lived assets are considered held for sale when certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is available for sale in its immediate condition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale were not significant as of December\\xa031, 2018 and 2019.48Table of ContentsAccrued Expenses and OtherIncluded in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to leases and asset retirement obligations, payroll and related expenses, unredeemed gift cards, customer liabilities, current debt, acquired digital media content, and other operating expenses. As of December\\xa031, 2018 and 2019, our liabilities for payroll related expenses were $3.4 billion and $4.3 billion and our liabilities for unredeemed gift cards were $2.8 billion and $3.3 billion. We reduce the liability for a gift card when redeemed by a customer. The portion of gift cards that we do not expect to be redeemed is recognized based on customer usage patterns.Unearned RevenueUnearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period. Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December\\xa031, 2018 was $7.9 billion, of which $6.3 billion was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2019 and our total unearned revenue as of December\\xa031, 2019 was $10.2 billion. Included in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets was $1.4 billion and $2.0 billion of unearned revenue as of December\\xa031, 2018 and 2019. Additionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in our financial statements. For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were $29.8 billion as of December\\xa031, 2019. The weighted average remaining life of our long-term contracts is 3.3 years. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term.Other Long-Term LiabilitiesIncluded in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to deferred tax liabilities, financing obligations, asset retirement obligations, tax contingencies, and digital video and music content.Foreign CurrencyWe have internationally-focused stores for which the net sales generated, as well as most of the related expenses directly incurred from those operations, are denominated in local functional currencies. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these stores is generally the same as the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at period-end foreign exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing throughout the period. Translation adjustments are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component of stockholders’ equity, and in the “Foreign currency effect on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash,” on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Transaction gains and losses including intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the settlement and remeasurement of intercompany balances, we recorded gains (losses) of $202 million, $(186) million, and $95 million in 2017, 2018, and 2019.Accounting Pronouncements Recently AdoptedIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) amending revenue recognition guidance and requiring more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2018 for all revenue contracts with our customers using the modified retrospective approach and increased retained earnings by approximately $650 million. The adjustment primarily relates to the unredeemed portion of our gift cards, which are now recognized over the expected customer usage period rather than waiting until gift cards expire or when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote. We changed the recognition and classification of Amazon Prime memberships, which are now accounted for as a single performance obligation and recognized ratably over the membership period as service sales. Previously, Prime memberships were considered to be arrangements with multiple deliverables and were allocated among product sales and service sales. Other changes relate primarily to the presentation of revenue. Certain advertising services are now classified as revenue rather than a reduction in cost of sales, and sales of apps, in-app content, and certain digital media content are presented on a net basis. Prior year amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting policy.The impact of applying this ASU for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily resulted in a decrease in product sales and an increase in service sales driven by the reclassification of Prime membership fees of approximately $3.8 billion. Service sales also increased by approximately $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the reclassification of certain advertising services.49Table of ContentsIn January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Under this ASU, certain equity investments are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 with no material impact to our consolidated financial statements.In February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for leases, primarily requiring the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for operating leases with terms of more than twelve months on our consolidated balance sheets. Under the new guidance, leases previously described as capital lease obligations and finance lease obligations are now referred to as finance leases and financing obligations, respectively. We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2019 by recording an immaterial cumulative adjustment to retained earnings rather than retrospectively adjusting prior periods. Prior period amounts were not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting policies resulting in a balance sheet presentation that is not comparable to the prior period in the first year of adoption. The adoption of this ASU resulted in the recognition of operating lease assets and liabilities of approximately $21 billion, which included the reclassification of finance lease obligations to operating leases of $1.2 billion. As of December 31, 2018, amounts related to finance lease obligations and construction liabilities totaled $9.6 billion, of which $1.5 billion was derecognized for buildings that we do not control during the construction period and $5.4 billion and $1.5 billion were reclassified to finance leases and operating leases, respectively.In October 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for income taxes. The new guidance requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intercompany asset transfer, other than transfers of inventory, when the transfer occurs.\\xa0For intercompany transfers of inventory, the income tax effects will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party.\\xa0We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 with an increase of approximately $250 million to retained earnings and deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances. In November 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the presentation of restricted cash within the consolidated statements of cash flows. The new guidance requires that restricted cash be added to cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statements of cash flows. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 on a retrospective basis with the following impacts to our consolidated statements of cash flows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2017Previously Reported\\xa0Adjustments\\xa0As RevisedOperating activities$18,434\\xa0$(69)\\xa0$18,365Investing activities(27,819)\\xa0735\\xa0(27,084)Financing activities9,860\\xa068\\xa09,928Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $475\\xa0$734\\xa0$1,209In March 2019, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for film costs, inclusive of episodic television and movie costs. The new guidance aligns the accounting for production costs of episodic television with that of movies by requiring production costs to be capitalized. Previously, we only capitalized a portion of the production costs related to our produced episodic television content. We adopted this ASU as of January 1, 2019 and began capitalizing substantially all of our production costs. Adoption of this ASU resulted in approximately $1.0 billion of incremental capitalized film costs classified in “Other Assets” as of December\\xa031, 2019.50Table of ContentsNote 2 — FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSCash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Marketable SecuritiesAs of December\\xa031, 2018 and 2019, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities primarily consisted of cash, AAA-rated money market funds, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, and other investment grade securities.

During 2017, we also acquired certain other companies for an aggregate purchase price of $204 million. The primary reason for our other 2017 acquisitions was to acquire technologies and know-how to enable Amazon to serve customers more effectively.2018 Acquisition ActivityOn April\\xa012, 2018, we acquired Ring Inc. (“Ring”) for cash consideration of approximately $839 million, net of cash acquired, and on September\\xa011, 2018, we acquired PillPack, Inc. (“PillPack”) for cash consideration of approximately $753 million, net of cash acquired, to expand our product and service offerings. During 2018, we also acquired certain other companies for an aggregate purchase price of $57 million. The primary reason for our other 2018 acquisitions was to acquire technologies and know-how to enable Amazon to serve customers more effectively.2019 Acquisition Activity During 2019, we acquired certain companies for an aggregate purchase price of $315 million. The primary reason for these acquisitions, none of which were individually material to our consolidated financial statements, was to acquire technologies and know-how to enable Amazon to serve customers more effectively.Acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred and were not significant.

The estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $24.3 billion and $26.2 billion as of December\\xa031, 2018 and 2019, which is based on quoted prices for our debt as of those dates.In October 2016, we entered into a $500 million secured revolving credit facility with a lender that is secured by certain seller receivables, which we subsequently increased to $740 million and may from time to time increase in the future subject to lender approval (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility is available until October 2022, bears interest at the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”) plus 1.40%, and has a commitment fee of 0.50% on the undrawn portion. There were $594 million and $740 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December\\xa031, 2018 and 2019, which had a weighted-average interest rate of 3.2% and 3.4% as of December\\xa031, 2018 and 2019. As of December\\xa031, 2018 and 2019, we 57Table of Contentshave pledged $686 million and $852 million of our cash and seller receivables as collateral for debt related to our Credit Facility. The estimated fair value of the Credit Facility, which is based on Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of December\\xa031, 2018 and 2019.The other debt, including the current portion, had a weighted-average interest rate of 6.0% and 4.1% as of December\\xa031, 2018 and 2019. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of this debt primarily to fund certain business operations. The estimated fair value of the other long-term debt, which is based on Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of December\\xa031, 2018 and 2019.As of December\\xa031, 2019, future principal payments for our total debt were as follows (in millions):Year Ended December 31,2020$1,30720211,14120221,77320231,51020243,339Thereafter15,750\\xa0$24,820In April 2018, we established a commercial paper program (the “Commercial Paper Program”) under which we may from time to time issue unsecured commercial paper up to a total of $7.0 billion at any time, with individual maturities that may vary but will not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program as of December\\xa031, 2018 and 2019. In April 2018, in connection with our Commercial Paper Program, we amended and restated our unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders to increase our borrowing capacity thereunder to $7.0 billion. As amended and restated, the Credit Agreement has a term of three years, but it may be extended for up to three additional one-year terms if approved by the lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the amended and restated Credit Agreement is LIBOR plus 0.50%, with a commitment fee of 0.04% on the undrawn portion of the credit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December\\xa031, 2018 and 2019.58Table of ContentsNote 7 — COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESCommitmentsWe have entered into non-cancellable operating and finance leases and financing obligations for equipment and office, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, data center, physical store, and renewable energy facilities.

For those digital media content agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the total obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of the reporting date. Purchase obligations associated with renewal provisions solely at the option of the content provider are included to the extent such commitments are fixed or a minimum amount is specified.(2)Includes the estimated timing and amounts of payments for rent and tenant improvements associated with build-to-suit lease arrangements and lease arrangements prior to the lease commencement date and digital media content liabilities associated with long-term digital media content assets with initial terms greater than one year.(3)Excludes approximately $3.9 billion of accrued tax contingencies for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment, if any.Pledged AssetsAs of December\\xa031, 2018 and 2019, we have pledged or otherwise restricted $575 million and $994 million of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and certain property and equipment as collateral for real estate leases, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit. Additionally, we have pledged our cash and seller receivables for debt related to our Credit Facility. See “Note\\xa06 — Debt.”SuppliersDuring 2019, no vendor accounted for 10% or more of our purchases. We generally do not have long-term contracts or arrangements with our vendors to guarantee the availability of merchandise, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits.Other ContingenciesIn 2016, we determined that we processed and delivered orders of consumer products for certain individuals and entities located outside Iran covered by the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act or other United States sanctions and export control laws. The consumer products included books, music, other media, apparel, home and kitchen, health and beauty, jewelry, office, consumer electronics, software, lawn and patio, grocery, and automotive products. Our review is ongoing and we have voluntarily reported these orders to the United States Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and the United States Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security. We intend to cooperate fully with OFAC and BIS with respect to their review, which may result in the imposition of penalties. For additional information, see Item 9B of Part II, “Other Information — Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act.”We are subject to claims related to various indirect taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, service, and similar taxes), including in jurisdictions in which we already collect and remit such taxes. If the relevant taxing authorities were successfully to pursue these claims, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. For example, in June 2017, the State of South Carolina issued an assessment for uncollected sales and use taxes for the period from January 2016 to March 2016, including interest and penalties. South Carolina is alleging that we should have collected sales and use taxes on 59Table of Contentstransactions by our third-party sellers. In September 2019, the South Carolina Administrative Law Court ruled in favor of the Department of Revenue and we have appealed the decision to the state Court of Appeals. We believe the assessment is without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If other tax authorities were successfully to seek additional adjustments of a similar nature, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities.Legal ProceedingsThe Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the following:Beginning in August 2013, a number of complaints were filed alleging, among other things, that Amazon.com, Inc. and several of its subsidiaries failed to compensate hourly workers for time spent waiting in security lines and otherwise violated federal and state wage and hour statutes and common law.\\xa0In August 2013, Busk v.

We have been named in several other similar cases. In December 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in Busk that time spent waiting for and undergoing security screening is not compensable working time under the federal wage and hour statute.

The estimated forfeiture rate as of December\\xa031, 2017, 2018, and 2019 was 28%, 27%, and 27%. Changes in our estimates and assumptions relating to forfeitures may cause us to realize material changes in stock-based compensation expense in the future. During 2017, 2018, and 2019, the fair value of restricted stock units that vested was $6.8 billion, $11.4 billion, and $11.7 billion.Common Stock Available for Future IssuanceAs of December\\xa031, 2019, common stock available for future issuance to employees is 108 million shares.Note 9 — INCOME TAXESIn 2017, 2018, and 2019, we recorded net tax provisions of $769 million, $1.2 billion, and $2.4 billion. Tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our U.S. taxable income. Cash taxes paid, net of refunds, were $957 million, $1.2 billion, and $881 million for 2017, 2018, and 2019.The U.S. Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The U.S. Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, introducing new tax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. The U.S. Tax Act also enhanced and extended accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. We reasonably estimated the effects of the U.S. Tax Act and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of December 31, 2017. We recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the U.S. Tax Act of approximately $789 million. This amount was primarily comprised of the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, after taking into account the mandatory one-time tax on the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The amount of this one-time tax was not material. In 2018, we completed our determination of the accounting implications of the U.S. Tax Act.63Table of ContentsThe components of the provision for income taxes, net are as follows (in millions):\\xa0Year Ended December 31,\\xa02017\\xa02018\\xa02019U.S. Federal:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Current$(137)\\xa0$(129)\\xa0$162Deferred(202)\\xa0565\\xa0914Total(339)\\xa0436\\xa01,076U.S. State:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Current211\\xa0322\\xa0276Deferred(26)\\xa05\\xa08Total185\\xa0327\\xa0284International:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Current724\\xa0563\\xa01,140Deferred199\\xa0(129)\\xa0(126)Total923\\xa0434\\xa01,014Provision for income taxes, net$769\\xa0$1,197\\xa0$2,374U.S. and international components of income before income taxes are as follows (in millions):\\xa0Year Ended December 31,\\xa02017\\xa02018\\xa02019U.S.$5,630\\xa0$11,157\\xa0$13,285International(1,824)\\xa0104\\xa0691Income before income taxes$3,806\\xa0$11,261\\xa0$13,976The items accounting for differences between income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate and the provision recorded for income taxes are as follows (in millions):\\xa0Year Ended December 31,\\xa02017\\xa02018\\xa02019Income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate (1)$1,332\\xa0$2,365\\xa0$2,935Effect of:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Tax impact of foreign earnings1,178\\xa0119\\xa0381State taxes, net of federal benefits114\\xa0263\\xa0221Tax credits(220)\\xa0(419)\\xa0(466)Stock-based compensation (2)(917)\\xa0(1,086)\\xa0(850)2017 Impact of U.S. Tax Act(789)\\xa0(157)\\xa0—Other, net71\\xa0112\\xa0153Total$769\\xa0$1,197\\xa0$2,374___________________(1)The U.S. Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal statutory rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018.(2)Includes non-deductible stock-based compensation and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our tax provision includes $1.3 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.4 billion of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation for 2017, 2018, and 2019.Our provision for income taxes in 2018 was higher than in 2017 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income and the one-time provisional tax benefit of the U.S. Tax Act recognized in 2017. This was partially offset by the reduction to the U.S. federal statutory tax rate in 2018, a decline in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may not realize a tax benefit and an increase in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.We regularly assess whether it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. In performing this assessment with respect to each jurisdiction, we review all available evidence, including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains, and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. In Q2 2017, we 64Table of Contentsrecognized an estimated charge to tax expense of $600 million to record a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in Luxembourg.Our provision for income taxes in 2019 was higher than in 2018 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income, a decline in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and the one-time provisional tax benefit of the U.S. Tax Act recognized in 2018. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings are subject to U.S. taxation under the U.S. Tax Act, which also repeals U.S. taxation on the subsequent repatriation of those earnings. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in millions):\\xa0December 31,\\xa02018\\xa02019Deferred tax assets (1):\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Loss carryforwards U.S. - Federal/States222\\xa0188Loss carryforwards - Foreign2,551\\xa03,232Accrued liabilities, reserves,\\xa0and other expenses1,064\\xa01,373Stock-based compensation1,293\\xa01,585Depreciation and amortization2,386\\xa02,385Operating lease liabilities—\\xa06,648Other items484\\xa0728Tax credits734\\xa0772Total gross deferred tax assets8,734\\xa016,911Less valuation allowances (2)(4,950)\\xa0(5,754)Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances3,784\\xa011,157Deferred tax liabilities:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Depreciation\\xa0and amortization(3,579)\\xa0(5,507)Operating lease assets—\\xa0(6,331)Other items(749)\\xa0(640)Net deferred tax assets (liabilities), net of valuation allowances$(544)\\xa0$(1,321)\\xa0___________________(1)Deferred tax assets are presented after tax effects and net of tax contingencies.(2)Relates primarily to deferred tax assets that would only be realizable upon the generation of net income in certain foreign taxing jurisdictions.Our valuation allowances primarily relate to foreign deferred tax assets, including substantially all of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards as of December\\xa031, 2019. Our foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes as of December\\xa031, 2019 were approximately $8.6 billion before tax effects and certain of these amounts are subject to annual limitations under applicable tax law. If not utilized, a portion of these losses will begin to expire in 2020. As of December\\xa031, 2019, our federal tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $1.7 billion. If not utilized, a portion of the tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2027. Tax ContingenciesWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate.65Table of ContentsThe reconciliation of our tax contingencies is as follows (in millions):\\xa0December 31,\\xa02017\\xa02018\\xa02019Gross tax contingencies – January\\xa01$1,710\\xa0$2,309\\xa0$3,414Gross increases to tax positions in prior periods223\\xa0164\\xa0216Gross decreases to tax positions in prior periods(139)\\xa0(90)\\xa0(181)Gross increases to current period tax positions518\\xa01,088\\xa0707Settlements with tax authorities—\\xa0(36)\\xa0(207)Lapse of statute of limitations(3)\\xa0(21)\\xa0(26)Gross tax contingencies – December\\xa031 (1)$2,309\\xa0$3,414\\xa0$3,923\\xa0___________________(1)As of December\\xa031, 2019, we had approximately $3.9 billion of accrued tax contingencies of which $2.1 billion, if fully recognized, would decrease our effective tax rate.As of December\\xa031, 2018 and 2019, we had accrued interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, related to tax contingencies of $127 million and $131 million. Interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, recognized for the years ended December\\xa031, 2017, 2018, and 2019 was $40 million, $20 million, and $4 million.We are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the calendar year 2007 and thereafter. These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods. In October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately\\xa0€250 million, plus interest, for the period May 2006 through June 2014, and ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission’s decision, that we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission’s decision. In May 2018, we appealed. We believe the European Commission’s decision to be without merit and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom.\\xa0We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2009 and thereafter.Changes in state, federal, and foreign tax laws may increase our tax contingencies. The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax examinations in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on tax filings in years through 2019. The actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possible outcomes.Note 10 — SEGMENT INFORMATIONWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses “Fulfillment,” “Technology and content,” “Marketing,” and “General and administrative” based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology infrastructure costs are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. The majority of the remaining non-infrastructure technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America segment. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable segments. These segments reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the Company’s business performance and manages its operations.66Table of ContentsNorth AmericaThe North America segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through North America-focused online and physical stores. This segment includes export sales from these online stores.InternationalThe International segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through internationally-focused online stores. This segment includes export sales from these internationally-focused online stores (including export sales from these online stores to customers in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada), but excludes export sales from our North America-focused online stores.AWSThe AWS segment consists of amounts earned from global sales of compute, storage, database, and other service offerings for start-ups, enterprises, government agencies, and academic institutions.Information on reportable segments and reconciliation to consolidated net income (loss) is as follows (in millions):\\xa0\\xa0Year Ended December 31,\\xa02017\\xa02018\\xa02019North America\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Net sales$106,110\\xa0$141,366\\xa0$170,773Operating expenses103,273\\xa0134,099\\xa0163,740Operating income$2,837\\xa0$7,267\\xa0$7,033International\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Net sales$54,297\\xa0$65,866\\xa0$74,723Operating expenses57,359\\xa068,008\\xa076,416Operating income (loss)$(3,062)\\xa0$(2,142)\\xa0$(1,693)AWS\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Net sales$17,459\\xa0$25,655\\xa0$35,026Operating expenses13,128\\xa018,359\\xa025,825Operating income$4,331\\xa0$7,296\\xa0$9,201Consolidated\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Net sales$177,866\\xa0$232,887\\xa0$280,522Operating expenses173,760\\xa0220,466\\xa0265,981Operating income4,106\\xa012,421\\xa014,541Total non-operating income (expense)(300)\\xa0(1,160)\\xa0(565)Provision for income taxes(769)\\xa0(1,197)\\xa0(2,374)Equity-method investment activity, net of tax(4)\\xa09\\xa0(14)Net income$3,033\\xa0$10,073\\xa0$11,58867Table of ContentsNet sales by groups of similar products and services, which also have similar economic characteristics, is as follows (in millions):\\xa0\\xa0Year Ended December 31,\\xa02017\\xa02018\\xa02019Net Sales:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Online stores (1)$108,354\\xa0$122,987\\xa0$141,247Physical stores (2)5,798\\xa017,224\\xa017,192Third-party seller services (3)31,881\\xa042,745\\xa053,762Subscription services (4)9,721\\xa014,168\\xa019,210AWS17,459\\xa025,655\\xa035,026Other (5)4,653\\xa010,108\\xa014,085Consolidated$177,866\\xa0$232,887\\xa0$280,522___________________(1)Includes product sales and digital media content where we record revenue gross.

Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of December\\xa031, 2019, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the 1934 Act. Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December\\xa031, 2019 based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of December\\xa031, 2019, our internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Ernst\\xa0& Young has independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and its report is included below. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December\\xa031, 2019 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on Controls Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 71Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and Shareholders Amazon.com, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingWe have audited Amazon.com, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December\\xa031, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December\\xa031, 2019, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December\\xa031, 2019 and the related notes and our report dated January\\xa030, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for OpinionThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)\\xa0pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\\xa0provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)\\xa0provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLPSeattle, Washington January\\xa030, 202072Table of ContentsItem\\xa09B.Other Information Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange ActWe determined that, between January 2012 and December 2019, we processed and delivered orders of consumer products for certain individuals and entities located outside Iran covered by the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act (“ITRA”), in addition to those we have previously disclosed, as follows: consumer products valued at approximately $13,700 for individuals who may have been acting for 14 Iranian embassies and diplomatic organizations located in countries other than Iran; consumer products valued at approximately $90 for an individual designated under Executive Order 13224; consumer products valued at approximately $8,600 for individuals who may have been acting for seven entities owned or controlled by the Iranian government; and consumer products valued at approximately $1,800 for individuals who may have been acting for five entities designated under Executive Order 13224 or Executive Order 13382, three of which are owned or controlled by the Iranian Government.

ERCOT serves as the independent system operator and regional reliability coordinator for member electric power systems in most of Texas. The ERCOT market represents approximately 90% of the demand for power in Texas and is one of the nation’s largest power markets. The ERCOT market operates under the reliability standards developed by the NERC, approved by the FERC and monitored and enforced by the Texas RE. The PUCT has primary jurisdiction over the ERCOT market to ensure the adequacy and reliability of electricity supply across the state’s main interconnected power transmission grid. Houston Electric does not make direct retail or wholesale sales of electric energy or own or operate any electric generating facilities. Electric Transmission\\xa0On behalf of REPs, Houston Electric delivers electricity from power plants to substations, from one substation to another and to retail electric customers taking power at or above 69 kV in locations throughout Houston Electric’s certificated service territory. Houston Electric constructs and maintains transmission facilities and provides transmission services under tariffs approved by the PUCT.3The ERCOT ISO is responsible for operating the bulk electric power supply system in the ERCOT market. Houston Electric’s transmission business, along with those of other owners of transmission facilities in Texas, supports the operation of the ERCOT ISO. Houston Electric participates with the ERCOT ISO and other ERCOT utilities to plan, design, obtain regulatory approval for and construct new transmission lines necessary to increase bulk power transfer capability and to remove existing constraints on the ERCOT transmission grid.\\xa0Electric Distribution\\xa0In ERCOT, end users purchase their electricity directly from certificated REPs. Houston Electric’s distribution network receives electricity from the transmission grid through power distribution substations and delivers electricity for REPs in its certificated service area by carrying lower-voltage power from the substation to the retail electric customer through distribution feeders. Houston Electric’s operations include construction and maintenance of distribution facilities, metering services, outage response services and call center operations. Houston Electric provides distribution services under tariffs approved by the PUCT. PUCT rules and market protocols govern the commercial operations of distribution companies and other market participants. Rates for these existing services are established pursuant to rate proceedings conducted before municipalities that have original jurisdiction and the PUCT.\\xa0Bond Companies Houston Electric has special purpose subsidiaries consisting of the Bond Companies, which it consolidates. These consolidated special purpose subsidiaries are wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote entities that were formed solely for the purpose of purchasing and owning transition or system restoration property through the issuance of Securitization Bonds, and conducting activities incidental thereto. The Securitization Bonds are repaid through charges imposed on customers in Houston Electric’s service territory.\\xa0For further discussion of the Securitization Bonds and the outstanding balances as of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.Customers\\xa0Houston Electric serves nearly all of the Houston/Galveston metropolitan area. As of  December\\xa031, 2019, Houston Electric’s customers consisted of approximately 68 REPs, which sell electricity to approximately 2.5 million metered customers in Houston Electric’s certificated service area, and municipalities, electric cooperatives and other distribution companies located outside Houston Electric’s certificated service area. Each REP is licensed by, and must meet minimum creditworthiness criteria established by, the PUCT. Houston Electric does not have long-term contracts with any of its customers. It operates using a continuous billing cycle, with meter readings being conducted and invoices being distributed to REPs each business day. For information regarding Houston Electric’s major customers, see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. The table below reflects the number of metered customers in Houston Electric’s service area as of December\\xa031, 2019:\\xa0Residential\\xa0Commercial/Industrial\\xa0Total CustomersTexas Gulf Coast 2,243,188\\xa0291,098\\xa02,534,286Utility TechnologyHouston Electric’s Smart Grid is comprised of the AMS, IG, ADMS and private telecommunications network. Houston Electric has deployed fully operational advanced meters to virtually all of its approximately 2.5 million metered customers, automated 95 substations, installed 1,603 IG Switching Devices and other automation devices on more than 450 circuits, built a wireless radio frequency mesh telecommunications network across Houston Electric’s 5,000-square mile footprint, and enabled real-time grid monitoring and control, which leverages information from smart meters and field sensors to manage system events through the ADMS. The Smart Grid continues to improve electric distribution service reliability and restoration, enhance the consumer experience, support the growth of renewable energy and help the environment by reducing carbon emissions. In addition, Houston Electric has implemented leading capabilities with customer service applications and mobile data applications including the PAS. The PAS notification tool alerts over 1.2 million registered customers of power delivery events at or near their home or facility via text, email or phone call.  4Competition\\xa0There are no other electric transmission and distribution utilities in Houston Electric’s service area. For another provider of transmission and distribution services to provide such services in Houston Electric’s territory, it would be required to obtain a certificate of convenience and necessity from the PUCT and, depending on the location of the facilities, may also be required to obtain franchises from one or more municipalities. Houston Electric is not aware of any other party intending to enter this business in its service area at this time. Distributed generation (i.e., power generation located at or near the point of consumption) could result in a reduction of demand for Houston Electric’s distribution services but has not been a significant factor to date.\\xa0Seasonality\\xa0Houston Electric’s revenues are primarily derived from rates that it collects from each REP based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of that REP. Houston Electric’s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage, with revenues generally being higher during the warmer months when more electricity is used for cooling purposes.\\xa0Properties\\xa0All of Houston Electric’s properties are located in Texas. Its properties consist primarily of high-voltage electric transmission lines and poles, distribution lines, substations, service centers, service wires, telecommunications network and meters. Most of Houston Electric’s transmission and distribution lines have been constructed over lands of others pursuant to easements or along public highways and streets under franchise agreements and as permitted by law.\\xa0All real and tangible properties of Houston Electric, subject to certain exclusions, are currently subject to:\\xa0•the lien of a Mortgage and Deed of Trust (the Mortgage) dated November\\xa01, 1944, as supplemented;\\xa0and\\xa0•the lien of a General Mortgage (the General Mortgage) dated October\\xa010, 2002, as supplemented, which is junior to the lien of the Mortgage.For information related to debt outstanding under the Mortgage and General Mortgage, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.\\xa0Electric Lines\\xa0- Transmission and Distribution.  As of December\\xa031, 2019, Houston Electric owned and operated the following electric transmission and distribution lines:\\xa0\\xa0Circuit MilesDescription\\xa0Overhead Lines\\xa0Underground LinesTransmission lines - 69 kV\\xa0259\\xa02Transmission lines - 138 kV\\xa02,215\\xa024Transmission lines - 345 kV\\xa01,337\\xa0—Total transmission lines\\xa03,811\\xa026Distribution lines\\xa029,303\\xa025,935 Substations.\\xa0\\xa0As of December\\xa031, 2019, Houston Electric owned 236 major substation sites having a total installed rated transformer capacity of 68,053 Mva.\\xa0Service Centers.\\xa0\\xa0As of December\\xa031, 2019, Houston Electric operated 15 regional service centers located on a total of 345\\xa0acres of land. These service centers consist of office buildings, warehouses and repair facilities that are used in the business of transmitting and distributing electricity.\\xa0Franchises\\xa0Houston Electric holds non-exclusive franchises from certain incorporated municipalities in its service territory. In exchange for the payment of fees, these franchises give Houston Electric the right to use the streets and public rights-of-way of these municipalities to construct, operate and maintain its transmission and distribution system and to use that system to conduct its 5electric delivery business and for other purposes that the franchises permit. The terms of the franchises, with various expiration dates, typically range from 20 to 40\\xa0years.Indiana Electric Integrated (CenterPoint Energy)Upon consummation of the Merger, CenterPoint Energy added Indiana Electric Integrated as a new reportable segment. Indiana Electric Integrated consists of SIGECO’s electric transmission and distribution services, including its power generating and wholesale power operations. As of December\\xa031, 2019, Indiana Electric supplied electric service to the following:\\xa0Residential\\xa0Commercial/Industrial\\xa0Total CustomersIndiana128,947\\xa018,995\\xa0147,942System LoadTotal load and the related reserve margin at the time of the system summer peak on September 12, 2019, is presented below in MW, except for reserved margin at peak.\\xa02019Total load at peak1,055\\xa0\\xa0Generating capability1,167Purchase supply (effective capacity)60Interruptible contracts\\xa0& direct load control62Total power supply capacity1,289Reserve margin at peak22%The winter peak load for the 2018-2019 season of approximately 757 MW occurred on January\\xa030, 2019.\\xa0Coal PurchasesCoal for coal-fired generating stations has been supplied from operators of nearby coal mines as there are substantial coal reserves in the southern Indiana area. Approximately 2.6\\xa0million tons were purchased for generating electricity during 2019.\\xa0Indiana Electric’s coal inventory was approximately 664,000 tons as of December\\xa031, 2019. The average cost of coal per ton purchased and delivered in 2019 was $50.67. Since August 2014, Indiana Electric has purchased substantially all of its coal from Sunrise Coal, LLC.Firm Purchase SupplyAs part of its power portfolio, Indiana Electric is a 1.5% shareholder in the OVEC, and based on its participation in the ICPA between OVEC and its shareholder companies, many of whom are regulated electric utilities, Indiana Electric has the right to 1.5% of OVEC’s generating capacity output, which, as of December\\xa031, 2019, was approximately 32 MWs.\\xa0Per the ICPA, Indiana Electric is charged demand charges which are based on OVEC’s operating expenses, including its financing costs.\\xa0Those demand charges are eligible to pass through to customers under Indiana Electric’s fuel adjustment clause. Under the ICPA, and while OVEC’s plants are operating, Indiana Electric is severally responsible for its share of OVEC’s debt obligations.\\xa0Based on OVEC’s current financing, as of December\\xa031, 2019, Indiana Electric’s 1.5% share of OVEC’s debt obligation equates to between $20\\xa0million and $25\\xa0million, depending on revolving capacity commitments.\\xa0Despite the bankruptcy proceedings of one of OVEC’s shareholders that holds a 4.9% interest under the ICPA, OVEC has represented it has both liquidity and financing capability that will allow it to continue to operate and provide power to its participating members, who include American Electric Power Company Inc., Duke Energy Corporation, and PPL Corporation. In 2019, Indiana Electric purchased approximately 121 GWh from OVEC. If a default were to occur by a member, any reallocation of the existing debt requires consent of the remaining ICPA participants. If any such reallocation were to occur, Indiana Electric would expect to recover any related costs through the fuel adjustment clause, as it does currently for its 1.5% share. In July 2019, the Ohio Legislature enacted House Bill 6, which provides for financial support to the members of OVEC serving Ohio customers.In April 2008, Indiana Electric executed a capacity contract with Benton County Wind Farm, LLC to purchase as much as 30 MW of energy from a wind farm located in Benton County, Indiana, with IURC approval.\\xa0The contract expires in 2029.\\xa0Indiana 6Electric purchased approximately 71 GWh in 2019 under this contract. In December 2009, Indiana Electric executed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Fowler Ridge II Wind Farm, LLC to purchase as much as 50 MW of energy from a wind farm located in Benton and Tippecanoe Counties in Indiana, with the approval of the IURC.\\xa0Indiana Electric purchased approximately 126 GWh in 2019 under this contract. In total, wind resources provided 4% of total GWh sourced in 2019.MISO Related ActivityIndiana Electric is a member of the MISO, a FERC approved regional transmission organization. The MISO serves the electric transmission needs of much of the Midcontinent region and maintains operational control over Indiana Electric’s electric transmission facilities as well as other utilities in the region. Indiana Electric is an active participant in the MISO energy markets, where it bids its generation into the Day Ahead and Real Time markets and procures power for its retail customers at LMP as determined by the MISO market. MISO-related purchase and sale transactions are recorded using settlement information provided by the MISO. These purchase and sale transactions are accounted for on at least a net hourly position.\\xa0During 2019, in intervals when purchases from the MISO were in excess of generation sold to the MISO, the net purchases were 447 GWh. During the year ended December\\xa031, 2019, in intervals when sales to the MISO were in excess of purchases from the MISO, the net sales were 377 GWh.InterconnectionsAs of December\\xa031, 2019, Indiana Electric had interconnections with Louisville Gas and Electric Company, Duke Energy Shared Services, Inc., Indianapolis Power\\xa0& Light Company, Hoosier Energy Rural Electric Cooperative, Inc. and Big Rivers Electric Corporation providing the ability to simultaneously interchange approximately 900 MW during peak load periods.\\xa0Indiana Electric, as required as a member of the MISO, has turned over operational control of the interchange facilities and its own transmission assets to the MISO. Indiana Electric, in conjunction with the MISO, must operate the bulk electric transmission system in accordance with NERC Reliability Standards. As a result, interchange capability varies based on regional transmission system configuration, generation dispatch, seasonal facility ratings and other factors. Indiana Electric is in compliance with reliability standards promulgated by the NERC. PropertiesGenerating Capacity. As of\\xa0December\\xa031, 2019, Indiana Electric had\\xa01,167\\xa0MW of installed generating capacity, as set forth in the following table.

In addition, Indiana Electric’s distribution system includes 81 distribution substations with an installed capacity of approximately 2,200 Mva and 55,727 distribution transformers with an installed capacity of 2,522 Mva.Natural Gas Distribution (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD engages in regulated intrastate natural gas sales and natural gas transportation and storage for residential, commercial, industrial and transportation customers. See the detail of customers by state below.  CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD also provides unregulated services in Minnesota consisting of residential appliance repair and maintenance services along with HVAC equipment sales. Upon consummation of the Merger, CenterPoint Energy added the legacy natural gas utility services of Vectren, which includes the natural gas utility operations of Indiana Gas, SIGECO and VEDO and provides natural gas distribution and transportation services to nearly two-thirds of Indiana and about 20% of Ohio, primarily in the west-central area. The Indiana and Ohio service areas contain diversified manufacturing and agriculture-related enterprises. CustomersIn 2019, approximately 35% and 39% of CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD’s total throughput was to residential customers and approximately 65% and 61% was to commercial and industrial and transportation customers, respectively. 8The table below reflects the number of CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD customers by state as of December\\xa031, 2019:\\xa0Residential\\xa0Commercial/Industrial/Transportation\\xa0Total CustomersArkansas376,160\\xa047,729\\xa0423,889Louisiana230,248\\xa016,560\\xa0246,808Minnesota807,713\\xa071,092\\xa0878,805Mississippi118,601\\xa013,055\\xa0131,656Oklahoma88,287\\xa010,768\\xa099,055Texas1,666,334\\xa0101,668\\xa01,768,002Total CERC NGD3,287,343\\xa0260,872\\xa03,548,215Indiana664,665\\xa064,382\\xa0729,047Ohio300,353\\xa024,495\\xa0324,848Total CenterPoint Energy NGD4,252,361\\xa0349,749\\xa04,602,110The largest metropolitan areas served in each state are Houston, Texas; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Little Rock, Arkansas; Shreveport, Louisiana; Biloxi, Mississippi; Lawton, Oklahoma; Evansville, Indiana and Dayton, Ohio.SeasonalityThe demand for natural gas sales to residential customers and natural gas sales and transportation for commercial and industrial customers is seasonal and affected by variations in weather conditions. In 2019, approximately 67% of CenterPoint Energy’s NGD’s total throughput and 69% of CERC’s NGD total throughput occurred in the first and fourth quarters. These patterns reflect the higher demand for natural gas for heating purposes during the colder months.Supply and Transportation.\\xa0\\xa0In 2019, CenterPoint Energy’s NGD purchased virtually all of its natural gas supply pursuant to contracts with remaining terms varying from a few months to four years. Certain contracts are firm commitments under five- and ten-year arrangements. Major suppliers are those that account for greater than\\xa010% of CenterPoint Energy’s or CERC’s annual natural gas supply purchases. In 2019, CenterPoint Energy and CERC purchased 53% and 46% of their natural gas supply from four and three major suppliers, respectively.\\xa0Numerous other suppliers provided the remainder of CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s natural gas supply requirements.CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD transports their natural gas supplies through various intrastate and interstate pipelines under contracts with remaining terms, including extensions, varying from one to sixteen years. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD anticipates that these gas supply and transportation contracts will be renewed or replaced prior to their expiration.CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD actively engages in commodity price stabilization pursuant to annual gas supply plans presented to and/or filed with each of its state regulatory authorities. These price stabilization activities include use of storage gas and contractually establishing structured prices (e.g., fixed price, costless collars and caps) with CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD’s physical gas suppliers. Their gas supply plans generally call for 50–75% of winter supplies to be stabilized in some fashion.\\xa0The regulations of the states in which CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD operates allow them to pass through changes in the cost of natural gas, including savings and costs of financial derivatives associated with the index-priced physical supply, to their customers under purchased gas adjustment provisions in their tariffs. Depending upon the jurisdiction, the purchased gas adjustment factors are updated periodically, ranging from monthly to semi-annually. The changes in the cost of gas billed to customers are subject to review by the applicable regulatory bodies.\\xa0CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD uses various third-party storage services or owned natural gas storage facilities to meet peak-day requirements and to manage the daily changes in demand due to changes in weather. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD may also supplement contracted supplies and storage from time to time with stored LNG and propane-air plant production.9As of December\\xa031, 2019, CenterPoint Energy and CERC’s NGD owned and operated the following natural gas facilities:\\xa0No. of Assets\\xa0Storage Capacity (Bcf)\\xa0Working Capacity (Bcf)\\xa0\\xa0Maximum Daily Withdrawal Rate (MMcf)CenterPoint Energy\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Underground Natural Gas Storage Facility9\\xa043.6\\xa014.2\\xa0337CERC\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Underground Natural Gas Storage Facility1\\xa07.0\\xa02.0\\xa050\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0On-site Storage Capacity\\xa0No. of Assets\\xa0Daily Production Rate (Dth)\\xa0Millions of Gallons\\xa0DthCenterPoint Energy\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Propane Air-Gas Manufacturing Plant13\\xa0231,000\\xa013.5\\xa01,187,000LNG Plant Facility1\\xa072,000\\xa012.0\\xa01,000,000CERC\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Propane Air-Gas Manufacturing Plant10\\xa0198,000\\xa012.0\\xa01,050,000LNG Plant Facility1\\xa072,000\\xa012.0\\xa01,000,000The table below reflects CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD contracted upstream storage services as of December 31, 2019:\\xa0\\xa0Storage Capacity (Bcf)\\xa0\\xa0Maximum Peak Daily Delivery (MMcf)CenterPoint Energy\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Upstream Storage Service\\xa0115\\xa02,744CERC\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Upstream Storage Service\\xa092\\xa02,298\\xa0On an ongoing basis, CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD enters into contracts to provide sufficient supplies and pipeline capacity to meet their customer requirements. However, it is possible for limited service disruptions to occur from time to time due to weather conditions, transportation constraints and other events. As a result of these factors, supplies of natural gas may become unavailable from time to time, or prices may increase rapidly in response to temporary supply constraints or other factors.\\xa0CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD has AMAs associated with their utility distribution service in Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas. The AMAs have varying terms, the longest of which expires in 2023. Pursuant to the provisions of the agreements, CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD either sells natural gas to the asset manager and agrees to repurchase an equivalent amount of natural gas throughout the year at the same cost, or simply purchases its full natural gas requirements at each delivery point from the asset manager. Generally, AMAs are contracts between CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD and an asset manager that are intended to transfer the working capital obligation and maximize the utilization of the assets. In these agreements, CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD agrees to release transportation and storage capacity to other parties to manage natural gas storage, supply and delivery arrangements for CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD and to use the released capacity for other purposes when it is not needed for CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD may receive compensation from the asset manager through payments made over the life of the AMAs.\\xa0CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD has an obligation to purchase their winter storage requirements that have been released to the asset manager under these AMAs.Assets\\xa0As of December\\xa031, 2019, CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD owned approximately 98,000 and 76,000 linear miles of natural gas distribution and transmission mains, respectively, varying in size from one-half inch to 24\\xa0inches in diameter.  CenterPoint Energy’s NGD in Indiana and Ohio includes approximately 22,000 miles of distribution and transmission mains, all of which are located in Indiana and Ohio except for pipeline facilities extending from points in northern Kentucky to points in 10southern Indiana so that gas may be transported to Indiana and sold or transported to customers in Indiana. Generally, in each of the cities, towns and rural areas served by CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD, they own the underground gas mains and service lines, metering and regulating equipment located on customers’ premises and the district regulating equipment necessary for pressure maintenance. With a few exceptions, the measuring stations at which CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD receives gas are owned, operated and maintained by others, and their distribution facilities begin at the outlet of the measuring equipment. These facilities, including odorizing equipment, are usually located on land owned by suppliers. Competition\\xa0CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources. In some areas, intrastate pipelines, other gas distributors and marketers also compete directly for gas sales to end users. In addition, as a result of federal regulations affecting interstate pipelines, natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be able to bypass CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD’s facilities and market, sell and/or transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial customers.Energy Services (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)CERC offers competitive variable and fixed-priced physical natural gas supplies primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and natural gas utilities through CES and its subsidiary, CEIP, collectively, Energy Services. In 2019, CES marketed approximately 1,305 Bcf of natural gas (including approximately 47 Bcf to affiliates) and provided related energy services and transportation to approximately 31,000 customers in over 30 states. CES customers vary in size from small commercial customers to large utility companies. Not included in the 2019 customer count are approximately 66,000 natural gas customers that are served under residential and small commercial choice programs invoiced by their host utility. These customers are not included in customer count so as not to distort the significant margin impact from the remaining customer base.CES offers a variety of natural gas management services to gas utilities, large industrial customers, electric generators, smaller commercial and industrial customers, municipalities, educational institutions, government facilities and hospitals. These services include load forecasting, supply acquisition, daily swing volume management, invoice consolidation, storage asset management, firm and interruptible transportation administration and forward price management. CES also offers a portfolio of physical delivery services designed to meet customers’ supply and risk management needs. These services include (1) through CEIP, permanent pipeline connections through interconnects with various interstate and intrastate pipeline companies and (2) through MES, temporary delivery of LNG and CNG throughout the lower 48 states, utilizing a fleet of customized equipment to provide continuity of natural gas service when pipeline supply is not available.In addition to offering natural gas management services, CES procures and optimizes transportation and storage assets. CES maintains a portfolio of natural gas supply contracts and firm transportation and storage agreements to meet the natural gas requirements of its customers. CES aggregates supply from various producing regions and offers contracts to buy natural gas with terms ranging from one month to over five years. In addition, CES actively participates in the spot natural gas markets to balance daily and monthly purchases and sales obligations. Natural gas supply and transportation capabilities are leveraged through contracts for ancillary services including physical storage and other balancing arrangements.As described above, CES offers its customers a variety of load following services. In providing these services, CES uses its customers’ purchase commitments to forecast and arrange its own supply purchases, storage and transportation services to serve customers’ natural gas requirements. As a result of the variance between this forecast activity and the actual monthly activity, CES will either have too much supply or too little supply relative to its customers’ purchase commitments. These supply imbalances arise each month as customers’ natural gas requirements are scheduled and corresponding natural gas supplies are nominated by CES for delivery to those customers. CES’s processes and risk control policy are designed to measure and value imbalances on a real-time basis to ensure that CES’s exposure to commodity price risk is kept to a minimum. The value assigned to these imbalances is calculated daily and is known as the aggregate VaR.\\xa0CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s risk control policy, which is overseen by CenterPoint Energy’s Risk Oversight Committee, defines authorized and prohibited trading instruments and trading limits. CES is a physical marketer of natural gas and uses a variety of tools, including pipeline and storage capacity, financial instruments and physical commodity purchase contracts, to support its sales. CES optimizes its use of these various tools to minimize its supply costs and does not engage in speculative commodity trading. CES currently operates within a VaR limit set by CenterPoint Energy’s Board of Directors, consistent with CES’ operational objective of matching its aggregate sales obligations (including the swing associated with load following services) with its supply portfolio in a manner that minimizes its total cost of supply. Should CES exceed this VaR limit, management is required to notify CenterPoint Energy’s Board of Directors. 11Assets \\xa0As of December\\xa031, 2019, CEIP owned and operated over 210\\xa0miles of intrastate pipeline in Louisiana and Texas. In addition, CES leases transportation capacity on various interstate and intrastate pipelines and storage to service its shippers and end users.\\xa0CompetitionCES competes with regional and national wholesale and retail gas marketers, including the marketing divisions of natural gas producers and utilities. In addition, CES competes with intrastate pipelines for customers and services in its market areas.On February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reportable segment. This transaction does not include CEIP and its assets. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. For further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements.Infrastructure Services (CenterPoint Energy)Infrastructure Services provides underground pipeline construction and repair services through wholly-owned subsidiaries Miller Pipeline, LLC and Minnesota Limited, LLC.\\xa0Infrastructure Services provides services to many utilities, including CenterPoint Energy’s utilities, as well as other industries.Backlog represents the amount of revenue Infrastructure Services expects to realize from work to be performed in the future on uncompleted contracts, including new contractual agreements on which work has not begun.\\xa0Infrastructure Services operates primarily under two types of contracts, blanket contracts and bid contracts.\\xa0Under blanket contracts, customers are not contractually committed to specific volumes of services; however, the Company expects to be chosen to perform work needed by a customer in a given time frame. These contracts are typically awarded on an annual or multi-year basis. For blanket work, backlog represents an estimate of the amount of revenue that Infrastructure Services expects to realize from work to be performed in the next twelve months on either existing contracts or contracts it reasonably expects to be renewed or awarded based upon recent history or discussions with customers. Under bid contracts, customers are contractually committed to a specific service to be performed for a specific price, whether in total for a project or on a per unit basis.\\xa0 Projects included in backlog can be subject to delays or cancellation as a result of regulatory requirements, adverse weather conditions and certain customer requirements, among other factors. Such delays or cancellations could cause realized revenue amounts to differ significantly from that which was originally expected. On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. For further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements.Midstream Investments (CenterPoint Energy)CenterPoint Energy’s Midstream Investments reportable segment consists of its equity method investment in Enable. Enable is a publicly traded MLP, jointly controlled by CenterPoint Energy (indirectly through CNP Midstream) and OGE as of December\\xa031, 2019.\\xa0 On September 4, 2018, CERC completed the Internal Spin of its equity investment in Enable, consisting of Enable common units and its interests in Enable GP, to CenterPoint Energy.  For further discussion of the Internal Spin, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.Enable.  Enable owns, operates and develops midstream energy infrastructure assets strategically located to serve its customers. Enable’s assets and operations are organized into two reportable segments: (i)\\xa0gathering and processing and (ii)\\xa0transportation and storage. Enable’s gathering and processing segment primarily provides natural gas gathering and processing to its producer customers and crude oil, condensate and produced water gathering services to its producer and refiner customers. Enable’s transportation and storage segment provides interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline transportation and storage services primarily to its producer, power plant, local distribution company and industrial end-user customers.Enable’s Gathering and Processing segment. Enable owns and operates substantial natural gas and crude oil gathering and natural gas processing assets in five states. Enable’s gathering and processing operations consist primarily of natural gas gathering 12and processing assets serving the Anadarko, Arkoma and Ark-La-Tex Basins, crude oil and condensate gathering assets serving the Anadarko Basin and crude oil and produced water gathering assets serving the Williston Basin. Enable provides a variety of services to the active producers in its operating areas, including gathering, compressing, treating, and processing natural gas, fractionating NGLs, and gathering crude oil and produced water. Enable serves shale and other unconventional plays in the basins in which it operates.Enable’s gathering and processing systems compete with gatherers and processors of all types and sizes, including those affiliated with various producers, other major pipeline companies and various independent midstream entities. Competition for crude oil, condensate, produced water and extracted NGL services also includes trucking and railroad transportation companies. In the process of selling NGLs, Enable competes against other natural gas processors extracting and selling NGLs. Enable’s primary competitors are other midstream companies who are active in the regions where it operates. Enable’s management views the principal elements of competition for its gathering and processing systems as gathering rate, processing value, system reliability, fuel rate, system run time, construction cycle time and prices at the wellhead. Enable’s Transportation and Storage segment. Enable owns and operates interstate and intrastate natural gas transportation and storage systems across nine states. Enable’s transportation and storage systems consist primarily of its interstate systems, its intrastate system and its investment in SESH. Enable’s transportation and storage assets transport natural gas from areas of production and interconnected pipelines to power plants, local distribution companies and industrial end users as well as interconnected pipelines for delivery to additional markets. Enable’s transportation and storage assets also provide facilities where natural gas can be stored by customers.Enable’s interstate and intrastate pipelines compete with a variety of other interstate and intrastate pipelines across its operating areas in providing transportation and storage services, including several pipelines with which it interconnects. Enable’s management views the principal elements of competition among pipelines as rates, terms of service, flexibility and reliability of service. For information related to CenterPoint Energy’s equity method investment in Enable, see Note 2(c) and Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.Corporate and Other Operations (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)CenterPoint Energy’s Corporate and Other Operations reportable segment consists of energy performance contracting and sustainable infrastructure services, such as renewables, distributed generation and combined heat and power projects, through ESG, home repair protection plans through a third party and other corporate support operations that support CenterPoint Energy’s business operations. CenterPoint Energy’s Corporate and Other Operations also includes office buildings and other real estate used for business operations.CERC’s Corporate and Other Operations reportable segment consists primarily of corporate operations which support all of the business operations of CERC and includes unallocated corporate costs and inter-segment eliminations.REGULATIONThe Registrants are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local governmental agencies, including the regulations described below. The following discussion is based on regulation in the Registrants’ businesses and CenterPoint Energy’s investment in Enable as of December\\xa031, 2019.Federal Energy Regulatory CommissionThe FERC has jurisdiction under the NGA and the NGPA, as amended, to regulate the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce and natural gas sales for resale in interstate commerce that are not first sales. The FERC regulates, among other things, the construction of pipeline and related facilities used in the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce, including the extension, expansion or abandonment of these facilities. The FERC has authority to prohibit market manipulation in connection with FERC-regulated transactions, to conduct audits and investigations, and to impose significant civil penalties (up to approximately $1.29 million per day per violation, subject to periodic adjustment to account for inflation) for statutory violations and violations of the FERC’s rules or orders. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Energy Services reportable segment markets natural gas in interstate commerce pursuant to blanket authority granted by the FERC.Indiana Electric is a “public utility” under the FPA and is subject to regulation by the FERC. The FERC regulates, among other things, the transmission and wholesale sales of electricity in interstate commerce, mergers, acquisitions and corporate transactions by electricity companies, energy markets, reliability standards and the issuance of short-term debt. The FERC also 13has authority to impose significant civil penalties (up to approximately $1.29 million per day per violation, subject to periodic adjustment to account for inflation) for statutory violations and violations of the FERC’s rules or orders. Houston Electric is not a “public utility” under the FPA and, therefore, is not generally regulated by the FERC, although certain of its transactions are subject to limited FERC jurisdiction. The FERC has certain responsibilities with respect to ensuring the reliability of electric transmission service, including transmission facilities owned by Houston Electric and other utilities within ERCOT. The FERC has designated the NERC as the ERO to promulgate standards, under FERC oversight, for all owners, operators and users of the bulk power system (Electric Entities). The ERO and the FERC have authority to (a) impose fines and other sanctions on Electric Entities that fail to comply with approved standards and (b) audit compliance with approved standards. The FERC has approved the delegation by the NERC of authority for reliability in ERCOT to the Texas RE and in the MISO to ReliabilityFirst Corporation. Neither Houston Electric nor Indiana Electric anticipate that the reliability standards proposed by the NERC and approved by the FERC will have a material adverse impact on their operations. To the extent that Houston Electric is required to make additional expenditures to comply with these standards, it is anticipated that Houston Electric and Indiana Electric will seek to recover those costs through the transmission charges that are imposed on all distribution service providers within ERCOT and the MISO, respectively, for electric transmission provided.As a public utility holding company, under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, CenterPoint Energy and its consolidated subsidiaries are subject to reporting and accounting requirements and are required to maintain certain books and records and make them available for review by the FERC and state regulatory authorities in certain circumstances.For a discussion of the Registrants’ ongoing regulatory proceedings, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference.State and Local Regulation – Electric Transmission & Distribution (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric)Houston Electric conducts its operations pursuant to a certificate of convenience and necessity issued by the PUCT that covers its present service area and facilities. The PUCT and certain municipalities have the authority to set the rates and terms of service provided by Houston Electric under cost-of-service rate regulation. Houston Electric holds non-exclusive franchises from certain incorporated municipalities in its service territory. In exchange for payment of fees, these franchises give Houston Electric the right to use the streets and public rights-of-way of these municipalities to construct, operate and maintain its transmission and distribution system and to use that system to conduct its electric delivery business and for other purposes that the franchises permit. The terms of the franchises, with various expiration dates, typically range from 20 to 40\\xa0years.Houston Electric’s distribution rates charged to REPs for residential and small commercial customers are primarily based on amounts of energy delivered, whereas distribution rates for a majority of large commercial and industrial customers are primarily based on peak demand. All REPs in Houston Electric’s service area pay the same rates and other charges for transmission and distribution services. This regulated delivery charge includes the transmission and distribution rate (which includes municipal franchise fees), a distribution recovery mechanism for recovery of incremental distribution-invested capital above that which is already reflected in the base distribution rate, a nuclear decommissioning charge associated with decommissioning the South Texas nuclear generating facility, an EECR charge, and charges associated with securitization of regulatory assets, stranded costs and restoration costs relating to Hurricane Ike. Transmission rates charged to distribution companies are based on amounts of energy transmitted under “postage stamp” rates that do not vary with the distance the energy is being transmitted. All distribution companies in ERCOT pay Houston Electric the same rates and other charges for transmission services.With the IURC’s approval, Indiana Electric is a member of the MISO, a FERC-approved regional transmission organization.  The MISO serves the electrical transmission needs of much of the midcontinent region and maintains operational control over Indiana Electric’s electric transmission and generation facilities as well as those of other utilities in the region. Indiana Electric is an active participant in the MISO energy markets, bidding its owned generation into the Day Ahead and Real Time markets and procuring power for its retail customers at Locational Marginal Pricing as determined by the MISO market. Indiana Electric also receives transmission revenue that results from other members’ use of Indiana Electric’s transmission system. Generally, these transmission revenues, along with costs charged by the MISO, are considered components of base rates and any variance from that included in base rates is recovered from or refunded to retail customers through tracking mechanisms.For a discussion of certain of Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s ongoing regulatory proceedings, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference.14State and Local Regulation – Electric Generation (CenterPoint Energy)Indiana Electric owns and operates 1,000 MW of coal-fired generation, 163 MW of gas-fired generation and 4 MW of solar generation. Indiana Electric also is party to two purchase power agreements, entitling it to the delivery of up to 80 MW of electricity produced by wind turbines. The energy and capacity secured from Indiana Electric’s available generation resources are utilized primarily to serve the needs of retail electric customers residing within Indiana Electric’s franchised service territory. Costs of operating Indiana Electric’s generation facilities are recovered through IURC-approved base rates as well as periodic rate recovery mechanisms including the CECA, DSMA, ECA, FAC, MCRA, RCRA Mechanism and TDSIC. Costs that are deemed unreasonable or imprudent by the IURC may not be recoverable through retail electric rates. Indiana Electric also receives revenues from the MISO to compensate it for benefits the generation facilities provide to the transmission system. Proceeds from the sales of energy from Indiana Electric’s generation facilities that exceed the requirements of retail customers are shared by Indiana Electric and retail electric customers.The generation facilities owned and operated by Indiana Electric are subject to various environmental regulations enforced by the EPA and the IDEM. Operation of Indiana Electric’s generation facilities are subject to regulation by the EPA and the IDEM as it pertains to the discharge of constituents from the generation facilities. For further discussion, see “Our Business — Environmental Matters” below. State and Local Regulation – Natural Gas Distribution (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)In almost all communities in which CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD provides natural gas distribution services, they operate under franchises, certificates or licenses obtained from state and local authorities. The original terms of the franchises, with various expiration dates, typically range from 10 to 30\\xa0years, although franchises in Arkansas are perpetual. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD expects to be able to renew expiring franchises. In most cases, franchises to provide natural gas utility services are not exclusive.Substantially all of CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD is subject to cost-of-service rate regulation by the relevant state public utility commissions and, in Texas, by those municipalities served by CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD that have retained original jurisdiction.  In certain of the jurisdictions in which they operate, CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD has annual rate adjustment mechanisms that provide for changes in rates dependent upon certain changes in invested capital, earned returns on equity or actual margins realized.  \\xa0For a discussion of certain of CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD’s ongoing regulatory proceedings, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference.Department of Transportation (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)In December 2006, Congress enacted the 2006 Act, which reauthorized the programs adopted under the 2002 Act.  These programs included several requirements related to ensuring pipeline safety, and a requirement to assess the integrity of pipeline transmission facilities in areas of high population concentration. Pursuant to the 2006 Act, PHMSA, an agency of the DOT, issued regulations, effective February 12, 2010, requiring operators of gas distribution pipelines to develop and implement integrity management programs similar to those required for gas transmission pipelines, but tailored to reflect the differences in distribution pipelines. Operators of natural gas distribution systems were required to write and implement their integrity management programs by August 2, 2011.  CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s natural gas distribution systems met this deadline.Pursuant to the 2002 Act and the 2006 Act, PHMSA has adopted a number of rules concerning, among other things, distinguishing between gathering lines and transmission facilities, requiring certain design and construction features in new and replaced lines to reduce corrosion and requiring pipeline operators to amend existing written operations and maintenance procedures and operator qualification programs.  PHMSA also updated its reporting requirements for natural gas pipelines effective January 1, 2011. In December 2011, Congress passed the 2011 Act. This act increased the maximum civil penalties for pipeline safety administrative enforcement actions; required the DOT to study and report on the expansion of integrity management requirements and the sufficiency of existing gathering line regulations to ensure safety; required pipeline operators to verify their records on maximum allowable operating pressure; and imposed new emergency response and incident notification requirements. In 2016, the 2016 Act reauthorized PHMSA’s pipeline safety programs through 2019 and provided limited new authority, including the 15ability to issue emergency orders, to set inspection requirements for certain underwater pipelines and to promulgate minimum safety standards for natural gas storage facilities, as well as to provide increased transparency into the status of as-yet-incomplete PHMSA actions required by the 2011 Act. Congress did not pass a bill reauthorizing PHMSA in 2019, and PHMSA is operating under a continuing resolution until a new bill is passed. PHMSA did receive federal funding for fiscal year 2020.CenterPoint Energy and CERC anticipate that compliance with PHMSA’s regulations, performance of the remediation activities by CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD and intrastate pipelines and verification of records on maximum allowable operating pressure will continue to require increases in both capital expenditures and operating costs. The level of expenditures will depend upon several factors, including age, location and operating pressures of the facilities. In particular, the cost of compliance with the DOT’s integrity management rules will depend on integrity testing and the repairs found to be necessary by such testing. Changes to the amount of pipe subject to integrity management, whether by expansion of the definition of the type of areas subject to integrity management procedures or of the applicability of such procedures outside of those defined areas, may also affect the costs incurred. Implementation of the 2011 and 2016 Acts, or implementation of future acts, by PHMSA may result in other regulations or the reinterpretation of existing regulations that could impact compliance costs. In addition, CenterPoint Energy and CERC may be subject to the DOT’s enforcement actions and penalties if they fail to comply with pipeline regulations.Midstream Investments – Rate and Other Regulation (CenterPoint Energy)\\xa0Federal, state, and local regulation of pipeline gathering and transportation services may affect certain aspects of Enable’s business and the market for its products and services, as discussed below.Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline RegulationEnable’s interstate pipeline systems—EGT, MRT and SESH—are subject to regulation by the FERC and are considered “natural gas companies” under the NGA. Under the NGA, the rates for service on Enable’s interstate facilities must be just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory. Rate and tariff changes for these facilities can only be implemented upon approval by the FERC. Enable’s interstate pipelines business operations may be affected by changes in the demand for natural gas, the available supply and relative price of natural gas in the Mid-continent and Gulf Coast natural gas supply regions and general economic conditions. Market Behavior Rules; Posting and Reporting RequirementsThe EPAct of 2005 amended the NGA and the FPA to add an anti-manipulation provision that makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior as prescribed in FERC rules, which were subsequently issued in FERC Order No. 670. The EPAct of 2005 also amends the NGA, the FPA and the NGPA to give the FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of these statutes and FERC’s regulations, rules, and orders, of up to approximately $1.29 million per day per violation, subject to periodic adjustment to account for inflation. Should Enable fail to comply with all applicable FERC-administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, it could be subject to substantial penalties and fines. In addition, the CFTC is directed under the CEA to prevent price manipulations for the commodity and futures markets, including the energy futures markets. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act and other authority, the CFTC has adopted anti-market manipulation regulations that prohibit fraud and price manipulation in the commodity and futures markets. The CFTC also has statutory authority to seek civil penalties of up to the greater of $1.2 million or triple the monetary gain to the violator for violations of the anti-market manipulation sections of the CEA. These maximum penalty levels are also subject to periodic adjustment to account for inflation.Intrastate Natural Gas Pipeline and Storage RegulationIntrastate natural gas transportation is largely regulated by the state in which the transportation takes place. However, an intrastate natural gas pipeline system may transport natural gas in interstate commerce provided that the rates, terms, and conditions of such transportation service comply with Section 311 of the NGPA and Part 284 of the FERC’s regulations. Rates for service pursuant to Section 311 of the NGPA are generally subject to review and approval by the FERC at least once every five years. Failure to observe the service limitations applicable to transportation services provided under Section 311, failure to comply with the rates approved by the FERC for Section 311 service, or failure to comply with the terms and conditions of service established in the pipeline’s FERC-approved Statement of Operating Conditions could result in the assertion of federal NGA jurisdiction by the FERC and/or the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as described under  “—Market Behavior Rules; Posting and Reporting Requirements” above.16Natural Gas Gathering and Processing RegulationSection 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of the FERC. Although the FERC has not made formal determinations with respect to all of the facilities Enable considers to be natural gas gathering facilities, Enable believes that its natural gas pipelines meet the traditional tests that the FERC has used to determine that a pipeline is a natural gas  gathering pipeline and is therefore not subject to FERC jurisdiction. The distinction, however, has been the subject of substantial litigation, and the FERC determines whether facilities are natural gas gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of Enable’s gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations. States may regulate gathering pipelines. State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, anti-discrimination requirements, and in some instances complaint-based rate regulation. Enable’s natural gas gathering operations may be subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in the states in which they operate.Enable’s gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services. Enable’s natural gas gathering operations could also be subject to additional safety and operational regulations relating to the design, construction, testing, operation, replacement and maintenance of gathering facilities. CenterPoint Energy cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on Enable’s operations, but the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes.Interstate Crude Oil Gathering RegulationEnable’s crude oil gathering systems in the Williston Basin transport crude oil in interstate commerce pursuant to a public tariff in accordance with FERC regulatory requirements.  Crude oil gathering pipelines that transport crude oil in interstate commerce may be regulated as common carriers by the FERC under the ICA, the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. The ICA and FERC regulations require that rates for interstate service pipelines that transport crude oil and refined petroleum products (collectively referred to as “petroleum pipelines”) and certain other liquids, be just and reasonable and non-discriminatory or not conferring any undue preference upon any shipper. FERC regulations also require interstate common carrier petroleum pipelines to file with the FERC and publicly post tariffs stating their interstate transportation rates and terms and conditions of service.Intrastate Crude Oil and Condensate Gathering RegulationEnable’s crude oil and condensate gathering system in the Anadarko Basin is located in Oklahoma and is subject to limited regulation by the OCC. Crude oil and condensate gathering systems are common carriers under Oklahoma law and are prohibited from unjust or unlawful discrimination in favor of one customer over another. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted from time to time. Enable’s crude oil and condensate gathering results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services.Safety and Health RegulationCertain of Enable’s facilities are subject to pipeline safety regulations. PHMSA regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of jurisdictional natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline facilities. All natural gas transmission facilities, such as Enable’s interstate natural gas pipelines, are subject to PHMSA’s regulations, but natural gas gathering pipelines are subject only to the extent they are classified as regulated gathering pipelines. In addition, several NGL pipeline facilities and crude oil pipeline facilities are regulated as hazardous liquids pipelines. Pursuant to various federal statutes, including the NGPSA, the DOT, through PHMSA, regulates pipeline safety and integrity. NGL and crude oil pipelines are subject to regulation by PHMSA under the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act which requires PHMSA to develop, prescribe, and enforce minimum federal safety standards for the transportation of hazardous liquids by pipeline, and comparable state statutes with respect to design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of pipeline facilities. Should Enable fail to comply with DOT or comparable state regulations, it could be subject to penalties and fines. If future DOT pipeline regulations were to require that Enable expand its integrity management program to currently unregulated pipelines, costs associated with compliance may have a material effect on its operations.17ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERSThe following discussion is based on environmental matters in the Registrants’ businesses as of December\\xa031, 2019. The Registrants’ operations and the operations of Enable are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to the environment. As an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines, distribution systems and storage, electric transmission and distribution systems, steam electric generation systems and the facilities that support these systems, the Registrants must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact the Registrants’ business activities in many ways, including, but not limited to:•restricting the way the Registrants can handle or dispose of wastes, including wastewater discharges and air emissions;•limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered species;•requiring remedial action and monitoring to mitigate environmental conditions caused by the Registrants’ operations or attributable to former operations;•enjoining the operations of facilities with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations; and•impacting the demand for the Registrants’ services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of fossil fuels, including, but not limited to, natural gas.To comply with these requirements, the Registrants may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to, among other activities:•construct or acquire new facilities and equipment;•acquire permits for facility operations or purchase emissions allowances;•modify, upgrade or replace existing and proposed equipment; and•decommission or remediate waste management areas, fuel storage facilities and other locations.Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, revocation of permits, the imposition of remedial actions and monitoring and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to assess, clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been stored, disposed or released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and/or property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment.The recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment.  There can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and monitoring, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts currently\\xa0anticipated. The Registrants try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to maintain compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations. Based on current regulatory requirements and interpretations, the Registrants do not believe that compliance with federal, state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on their business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, the Registrants believe that their current environmental remediation activities will not materially interrupt or diminish their operational ability. The Registrants cannot assure you that future events, such as changes in existing laws, the promulgation of new laws, or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause them to incur significant costs. The following is a discussion of material current environmental and safety issues, laws and regulations that relate to the Registrants’ operations. The Registrants believe that they are in substantial compliance with these environmental laws and regulations.Global Climate ChangeThere is increasing attention being paid in the United States and worldwide to the issue of climate change. As a result, from time to time, regulatory agencies have considered the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or 18regulations addressing the emissions of GHG on the state, federal, or international level. Some of the proposals would require industrial sources to meet stringent new standards that would require substantial reductions in GHG emissions.\\xa0CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s revenues, operating costs and capital requirements could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of their operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas. One such rule, the ACE rule, which was finalized by the EPA in 2019, requires states to establish heat rate performance standards for steam electric generating facilities. Under the ACE rule, a state has three years to finalize its program and the EPA then has 18 months to approve, making compliance by Indiana Electric’s generating units required in 2023-2024.     Houston Electric, in contrast to some electric utilities, does not generate electricity and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity.\\xa0Nevertheless, CenterPoint Energy’s and Houston Electric’s revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within Houston Electric’s service territory. Likewise, incentives to conserve energy or to use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for the Registrants’ services.\\xa0Conversely, regulatory actions that effectively promote the consumption of natural gas because of its lower emissions characteristics would be expected to beneficially affect CenterPoint Energy and CERC and their natural gas-related businesses.\\xa0At this point in time, however, it would be speculative to try to quantify the magnitude of the impacts from possible new regulatory actions related to GHG emissions, either positive or negative, on the Registrants’ businesses.To the extent climate changes may occur and such climate changes result in warmer temperatures in the Registrants’ or Enable’s service territories, financial results from the Registrants’ and Enable’s businesses could be adversely impacted. For example, CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD could be adversely affected through lower natural gas sales and Enable’s natural gas gathering, processing and transportation and crude oil gathering businesses could experience lower revenues. On the other hand, warmer temperatures in CenterPoint Energy’s and Houston Electric’s electric service territory may increase revenues from transmission and distribution and generation through increased demand for electricity for cooling.\\xa0Another possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes or tornadoes.\\xa0Since many of the Registrants’ facilities are located along or near the Gulf Coast, increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to customers. When the Registrants cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers, or customers cannot receive services, the Registrants’ financial results can be impacted by lost revenues, and they generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs.\\xa0To the extent the Registrants are unable to recover those costs, or if higher rates resulting from recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for services, the Registrants’ future financial results may be adversely impacted.Air EmissionsThe Registrants’ operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including processing plants and compressor stations, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in the increase of existing air emissions. The Registrants may be required to obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations, or utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations, and potentially criminal enforcement actions. The Registrants may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions.The EPA has established new air emission control requirements for natural gas and NGLs production, processing and transportation activities. Under the NESHAPS, the EPA established the RICE MACT rule. Compressors and back up electrical generators used by CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD, and back up electrical generators used by CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric, are substantially compliant with these laws and regulations. Similarly, the EPA also established the MATS rule, which sets emission limits for mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from steam electric generating facilities. Indiana Electric’s generating units are in full compliance with the MATS rule.19Water DischargesThe Registrants’ operations are subject to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also known as the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations impose detailed requirements and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States. The unpermitted discharge of pollutants, including discharges resulting from a spill or leak incident, is prohibited. The Clean Water Act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit discharges of dredged and fill material into wetlands and other waters of the United States unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. Any unpermitted release of petroleum or other pollutants from the Registrants’ pipelines or facilities could result in fines or penalties as well as significant remedial obligations.Waters of the United StatesUnder the Obama administration, the EPA promulgated a set of rules that included a comprehensive regulatory overhaul of defining “waters of the United States” for the purposes of determining federal jurisdiction. The Trump administration signaled its intent to repeal and replace the Obama-era rules. In accordance with this intent, the EPA promulgated a rule in early 2018 that postponed the effectiveness of the Obama-era rules until 2020. Thereafter, the EPA proposed a new set of rules that would narrow the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction, which were released in January 2020 and will become final upon publication in the Federal Register. Environmental stakeholders and certain states have indicated their intent to challenge the new rule and further litigation is likely. The potential impact of any new “waters of the United States” regulations on the Registrants’ business, liabilities, compliance obligations or profits and revenues is uncertain at this time.ELGIn 2015 the EPA finalized revisions to the existing steam electric wastewater discharge standards which set more stringent wastewater discharge limits and effectively prohibited further wet disposal of coal ash in ash ponds.  These new standards are applied at the time of permit renewal and an affected facility must comply no later than December 31, 2023. In February 2019, the IURC approved Indiana Electric’s ELG compliance plan for its F.B. Culley Generating Station, and Indiana Electric is currently finalizing its ELG compliance plan for the remainder of its affected units as part of its ongoing IRP process.Cooling Water Intake StructuresSection 316 of the federal Clean Water Act requires steam electric generating facilities use “best technology available” to minimize adverse environmental impacts on a body of water. In May 2014 EPA finalized a regulation requiring installation of BTA to mitigate impingement and entrainment of aquatic species in cooling water intake structures. Indiana Electric is currently completing the required ecological studies and anticipates timely compliance in 2021-2022.   Hazardous WasteThe Registrants’ operations generate wastes, including some hazardous wastes, that are subject to the federal RCRA, and comparable state laws, which impose detailed requirements for the handling, storage, treatment, transport and disposal of hazardous and solid waste. RCRA currently exempts many natural gas gathering and field processing wastes from classification as hazardous waste. Specifically, RCRA excludes from the definition of hazardous waste waters produced and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or\\xa0production of crude oil and natural gas. However, these oil and gas exploration and production wastes are still regulated under state law and the less stringent non-hazardous waste requirements of RCRA. Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes such as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste compressor oils may be regulated as hazardous waste. The transportation of natural gas in pipelines may also generate some hazardous wastes that would be subject to RCRA or comparable state law requirements.Coal AshIndiana Electric has three ash ponds, two at the F.B. Culley facility (Culley East and Culley West) and one at the A.B. Brown facility. In 2015, the EPA finalized its CCR Rule, which regulates coal ash as non-hazardous material under the RCRA. The final rule allows beneficial reuse of ash, and the majority of the ash generated by Indiana Electric’s generating plants will continue to be reused. Under the existing CCR Rule, Indiana Electric is required to perform integrity assessments, including ground water monitoring, at its F.B. Culley and A.B. Brown generating stations. The ground water studies are necessary to determine the remaining service life of the ponds and whether a pond must be retrofitted with liners or closed in place. In March 2018, Indiana Electric began posting ground water data monitoring reports annually to its public website in accordance with the requirements of the CCR Rule. This data preliminarily indicates potential groundwater impacts very close to Indiana Electric’s ash impoundments, and further analysis is ongoing.The CCR Rule required companies to complete location restriction determinations by October 18, 202018. Indiana Electric completed its evaluation and determined that one F.B. Culley pond (Culley East) and the A.B. Brown pond fail the aquifer placement location restriction. As a result of this failure, Indiana Electric is required to cease disposal of new ash in the ponds and commence closure of the ponds by August 2020. Indiana Electric plans to seek extensions available under the CCR Rule that would allow Indiana Electric to continue to use the ponds through December 31, 2023. The inability to take these extensions may result in increased and potentially significant operational costs in connection with the accelerated implementation of an alternative ash disposal system or adversely impact Indiana Electric’s future operations. Failure to comply with these requirements could also result in an enforcement proceeding, including the imposition of fines and penalties. For further discussion about Indiana Electric’s ash ponds, please see Note 16(e) to the consolidated financial statements. Liability for RemediationCERCLA, also known as “Superfund,” and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons responsible for the release of “hazardous substances” into the environment. Classes of PRPs include the current and past owners or operators of sites where a hazardous substance was released and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at offsite locations such as landfills. Although petroleum, as well as natural gas, is expressly excluded from CERCLA’s definition of a “hazardous substance,” in the course of the Registrants’ ordinary operations they do, from time to time, generate wastes that may fall within the definition of a “hazardous substance.” CERCLA authorizes the EPA and, in some cases, third parties to take action in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to recover the costs they incur from the responsible classes of persons. Under CERCLA, the Registrants could potentially be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up and restoring sites where hazardous substances have been released, for damages to natural resources, and for associated response and assessment costs, including for the costs of certain health studies.Liability for Preexisting ConditionsFor information about preexisting environmental matters, please see Note 16(e) to the consolidated financial statements.EMPLOYEESThe following table sets forth the number of employees by Registrant and reportable segment as of December\\xa031, 2019:\\xa0\\xa0Number of Employees\\xa0Number of Employees Represented by Collective Bargaining GroupsReportable Segment\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERCHouston Electric T&D\\xa02,768\\xa02,768\\xa0—\\xa01,424\\xa01,424\\xa0—Indiana Electric Integrated\\xa0443\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0221\\xa0—\\xa0—Natural Gas Distribution\\xa04,003\\xa0—\\xa03,284\\xa01,632\\xa0—\\xa01,207Energy Services\\xa0293\\xa0—\\xa0293\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0—Infrastructure Services\\xa04,345\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa03,850\\xa0—\\xa0—Corporate and Other \\xa02,410\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0178\\xa0—\\xa0—Total\\xa014,262\\xa02,768\\xa03,577\\xa07,305\\xa01,424\\xa01,207For information about the status of collective bargaining agreements, see Note 8(j) to the consolidated financial statements.On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reportable segment.

CenterPoint Energy also owns interests in Enable. The following, along with any additional legal proceedings identified or incorporated by reference in Item\\xa03 of this combined report on Form 10-K, summarizes the principal risk factors associated with the holding company, the businesses conducted by its subsidiaries and its interests in Enable. However, additional risks and uncertainties either not presently known or not currently believed by management to be material may also adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s businesses. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ from those indicated in any forward-looking statement or projection contained in this combined report on Form 10-K, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Certain Factors Affecting Future Earnings” in Item 7, which should be read in conjunction with the risk factors contained in this Item 1A. Carefully consider each of the risks described below, including those relating to Houston Electric and CERC, which, along with CenterPoint Energy, are collectively referred to as the Registrants. Unless the context indicates otherwise, where appropriate, information relating to a specific registrant has been segregated and labeled as such and specific references to Houston Electric and CERC in this section also pertain to CenterPoint Energy. In this combined report on Form 10-K, the terms “our,” “we” and “us” are used as abbreviated references to CenterPoint Energy, Inc. together with its subsidiaries. Risk Factors Associated with Our Consolidated Financial ConditionCenterPoint Energy is a holding company with no operations or operating assets of its own. As a result, CenterPoint Energy depends on the performance of and distributions from its subsidiaries and from Enable to meet its payment obligations and to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock, and provisions of applicable law or contractual restrictions could limit the amount of those distributions. CenterPoint Energy derives all of its operating income from, and holds all of its assets through, its subsidiaries, including its interests in Enable. As a result, CenterPoint Energy depends on distributions from its subsidiaries and Enable to meet its payment obligations and to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock. In general, CenterPoint Energy’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide it with funds for its payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or otherwise. In addition, provisions of applicable law, such as those limiting the legal sources of dividends, limit CenterPoint Energy’s subsidiaries’ and Enable’s ability to make payments or other distributions to CenterPoint Energy, and its subsidiaries or Enable could agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make payments or other distributions. For a description of these restrictions and further information on ring-fencing measures that may adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s ability to receive dividends from Houston Electric as well as other financial impacts, please read “—The imposition of certain 23ring-fencing measures at Houston Electric could adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows, credit quality, financial condition and results of operations.”\\xa0\\xa0Additionally, CenterPoint Energy’s results of operations, future growth and earnings and dividend goals depend on the performance of its utility and non-utility (such as CES, Infrastructure Services and ESG) subsidiaries which contribute to a portion of its consolidated earnings and which may not perform at expected or forecasted levels or do not achieve the projected growth in these businesses as anticipated. As part of their non-utility businesses, CenterPoint Energy and CERC also offer home repair protection plans to natural gas customers in Texas and Louisiana (through a third-party provider) and provide home appliance maintenance and repair services to customers in Minnesota. For a discussion of risks that may impact the amount of cash distributions CenterPoint Energy receives with respect to its interests in Enable, please read “— Additional Risk Factors Affecting CenterPoint Energy’s Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LP — CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows will be adversely impacted if it receives less cash distributions from Enable than it currently expects.” CenterPoint Energy’s right to receive any assets of any subsidiary, and therefore the right of its creditors to participate in those assets, will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors. In addition, even if CenterPoint Energy were a creditor of any subsidiary, its rights as a creditor would be effectively subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness of the subsidiary senior to that held by CenterPoint Energy.If we are unable to arrange future financings on acceptable terms, our ability to finance our capital expenditures or refinance outstanding indebtedness could be limited.Our businesses are capital intensive, and we rely on various sources to finance our capital expenditures. For example, we depend on (i) long-term debt, (ii) borrowings through our revolving credit facilities and, for CenterPoint Energy and CERC, commercial paper programs, (iii) distributions from CenterPoint Energy’s interests in Enable and (iv) if market conditions permit, issuances of additional shares of common and/or preferred stock by CenterPoint Energy.  We may also use such sources to refinance any outstanding indebtedness as it matures. As of December\\xa031, 2019, CenterPoint Energy had $15.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, which includes $977 million of non-recourse Securitization Bonds. For information on maturities through 2024, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. Our future financing activities may be significantly affected by, among other things:•general economic and capital market conditions;•credit availability from financial institutions and other lenders;•volatility or fluctuations in distributions from Enable’s units or volatility in Enable’s unit price;•investor confidence in us and the markets in which we operate;•the future performance of our and Enable’s businesses;•integration of Vectren’s businesses into CenterPoint Energy;•maintenance of acceptable credit ratings;•market expectations regarding our future earnings and cash flows;•our ability to access capital markets on reasonable terms;•incremental collateral that may be required due to regulation of derivatives; and•provisions of relevant tax and securities laws.As of December\\xa031, 2019, Houston Electric had approximately $4.0 billion aggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds outstanding under the General Mortgage, including approximately $68 million held in trust to secure pollution control bonds for which CenterPoint Energy is obligated.  Additionally, as of December\\xa031, 2019, Houston Electric had approximately $102 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds outstanding under the Mortgage. Houston Electric may issue additional general mortgage bonds on the basis of retired bonds, up to 70% of property additions or cash deposited with the trustee. As of December\\xa031, 2019, approximately $3.7 billion of additional first mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds in the aggregate could be issued on the basis of retired bonds and 70% of property additions as of December\\xa031, 2019. However, Houston Electric 24has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds, subject to certain exceptions. As of December\\xa031, 2019, SIGECO had approximately $293 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds outstanding. SIGECO may issue additional bonds under its Mortgage Indenture up to 60% of currently unfunded property additions. As of December\\xa031, 2019, approximately $1.1 billion of additional first mortgage bonds could be issued on this basis. However, under certain circumstances Indiana Electric is limited in its ability to issue additional bonds under the Mortgage Indenture due to a provision in its parent’s, VUHI, indentures.The Registrants’ current credit ratings and any changes in credit ratings in 2019 and to date in 2020 are discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Other Matters — Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings” in Item 7 of Part II of this report. These credit ratings may not remain in effect for any given period of time and one or more of these ratings may be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. The Registrants note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold their securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of the Registrants’ credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on their ability to access capital on acceptable terms. The imposition of certain ring-fencing measures at Houston Electric could adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows, credit quality, financial condition and results of operations. As part of its most recent base rate proceeding, Houston Electric has agreed, as part of a settlement, to certain “ring-fencing” measures to increase its financial separateness from CenterPoint Energy. As part of the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement, Houston Electric and CenterPoint Energy are subject to various ring-fencing measures. For further information about the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement, please see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report. Additionally, further ring-fencing measures could be imposed on Houston Electric in the future through legislation or PUCT rules or orders. As a result of such ring-fencing measures, CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows, credit quality, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Changes in the method of determining LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect the cost of capital related to outstanding debt and other financial instruments.The LIBOR is the basic rate of interest widely used as a global reference for setting interest rates on variable rate loans and other securities. Each of the Registrants’ credit and term loan facilities, including certain facilities or financial instruments entered into by their subsidiaries, use LIBOR as a reference rate. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021.  It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. If LIBOR reference rates become unavailable, any LIBOR borrowings under the Registrants’ credit and term loan facilities would convert at the end of the applicable interest period to alternate base rate loans and any future borrowings thereunder would be made as alternate base rate loans. Alternate base rate loans generally constitute a higher cost of capital. Certain of CenterPoint Energy’s credit and term loan facilities provide for a mechanism to amend such facility to reflect the establishment of an alternative reference rate upon the inability to determine the LIBOR-based Eurodollar rate or occurrence of certain events related to the phase-out of LIBOR. However, we have not yet pursued any technical amendment or other contractual alternative to address this matter and are currently evaluating the impact of the potential replacement or unavailability of the LIBOR interest rate. In addition, the overall financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential phase-out and alternative reference rates or disruption in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.An impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets, including intangible assets, equity method investments and an impairment or fair value adjustment to CenterPoint Energy’s Enable Series A Preferred Unit investment could reduce our earnings.Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price of a business exceeds the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require CenterPoint Energy to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired. Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. As a result of the Merger, CenterPoint Energy has increased the amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on its consolidated financial statements that are subject to impairment based on future adverse changes to the acquired businesses or general market conditions. 25In connection with its preparation of financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, CenterPoint Energy and CERC, as applicable, identified triggering events for interim goodwill impairment tests at their Infrastructure Services and Energy Services reporting units. Early stage bids received from market participants during the exploration of strategic alternatives for these businesses at year-end indicated that the carrying value of each reporting unit was more likely than not below the fair value.\\xa0As a result, CenterPoint Energy and CERC evaluated long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, and specifically identifiable intangibles subject to amortization, for recoverability and the goodwill within the reporting units was tested for impairment as of December 31, 2019.  The long-lived assets within the Infrastructure Services and Energy Services reporting units were determined to be recoverable based on undiscounted cash flows, considering the likelihood of possible outcomes existing as of December 31, 2019, including the assessment of the likelihood of a future sale of these assets. CenterPoint Energy and CERC recognized an impairment loss of $48 million, the amount by which the carrying value (inclusive of deferred income tax liabilities of $25 million) of their respective Energy Services reporting unit exceeded fair value as of December 31, 2019. Following the impairment, the carrying value of the goodwill remaining in the Energy Services reporting unit is $62 million as of December 31, 2019.  CenterPoint Energy did not recognize any impairments on its Infrastructure Services reporting unit in 2019.On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reporting unit.  As a result, certain assets and liabilities representing a business within this reporting unit that will be transferred under the Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Disposal Group”) met the held for sale criteria during the first quarter of 2020.  Because the transaction is structured as an asset sale for income tax purposes, the Disposal Group will exclude the deferred tax liabilities. CenterPoint Energy anticipates recording an impairment loss on assets held for sale of approximately $85 million, plus an additional loss for transaction costs, in the first quarter of 2020. The actual amount of the impairment or loss may be materially different from the preliminary amount.Additionally, on February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reporting unit. Certain assets and liabilities representing a business within this reporting unit that will be transferred under the Equity Purchase Agreement (the “Disposal Group”) met the held for sale criteria during the first quarter of 2020.  Because the transaction is structured as an asset sale for income tax purposes, the Disposal Group will exclude the deferred tax liabilities and certain assets and liabilities within the reporting unit that will be retained by CenterPoint Energy and CERC upon closing.  CenterPoint Energy and CERC anticipate recording an impairment loss, consisting of both goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, on assets held for sale of approximately $80 million, plus an additional loss for transaction costs, in the first quarter of 2020.  The actual amount of the impairment or loss may be materially different from the preliminary amount. For investments CenterPoint Energy accounts for under the equity method, the impairment test considers whether the fair value of such investment as a whole, not the underlying net assets, has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary. For example, if Enable’s common unit price, distributions or earnings were to decline, and that decline is deemed to be other than temporary, CenterPoint Energy could determine that it is unable to recover the carrying value of its equity investment in Enable. Considerable judgment is used in determining if an impairment loss is other than temporary and the amount of any impairment. Such an impairment occurred during the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the sustained low Enable common unit price and further declines in such price that year, among other factors impacting the midstream oil and gas industry. As of December 31, 2019, CenterPoint Energy’s total investment in Enable is $10.29 per unit and Enable’s common unit price closed at $10.03 per unit (approximately $61 million below carrying value). Based on an analysis of its investment in Enable as of December 31, 2019, CenterPoint Energy believes that the decline in the value of its investment is temporary, and that the carrying value of its investment of $2.4 billion will be recovered. On February 24, 2020, Enable’s common unit price closed at $7.63 (approximately $622 million below carrying value). A sustained low Enable common unit price could result in CenterPoint Energy again recording impairment charges in the future. For investments CenterPoint Energy accounts for as investments without a readily determinable fair value, such as the Enable Series A Preferred Unit investment, the carrying value of the asset may be adjusted to fair value, resulting in a gain or loss in the period, if a transaction on an identical or similar investment in Enable is observed.  Additionally, CenterPoint Energy considers qualitative impairment triggers, such as significant deterioration in earnings performance, significant decline in market condition and other factors that raise significant concerns about Enable’s ability to continue as a going concern, to determine if an impairment analysis should be performed on its investment. Should the annual impairment test or another periodic impairment test or an observable transaction, as described above, indicate the fair value of our assets is less than the carrying value, we would be required to take a non-cash charge to earnings with a correlative effect on equity and balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization. A non-cash impairment charge or fair value adjustment could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.26Changing demographics, poor investment performance of pension plan assets and other factors adversely affecting the calculation of pension liabilities could unfavorably impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial position.CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries maintain qualified defined benefit pension plans covering certain of its employees. Costs associated with these plans are dependent upon a number of factors including the investment returns on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to calculate the funded status of the plan, contributions to the plan, the number of plan participants and government regulations with respect to funding requirements and the calculation of plan liabilities. Funding requirements may increase and CenterPoint Energy may be required to make unplanned contributions in the event of a decline in the market value of plan assets, a decline in the interest rates used to calculate the present value of future plan obligations, or government regulations that increase minimum funding requirements or the pension liability. In addition to affecting CenterPoint Energy’s funding requirements, each of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial position.CenterPoint Energy, through Infrastructure Services, also contributes to several multi-employer pension plans. If Infrastructure Services withdraws from these plans, CenterPoint Energy may be required to pay an amount based on the allocable share of the plans’ unfunded vested benefits, referred to as the withdrawal liability. This could adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial position.The costs of providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees may increase substantially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We provide health care benefits to eligible employees and retirees through self-insured and insured plans. In recent years, the costs of providing these benefits per beneficiary increased due to higher health care costs and higher levels of large individual health care claims and overall health care claims. We anticipate that such costs will continue to rise. Further, the effects of health care reform or any future legislative changes could also materially affect our health care benefit programs and costs. Any potential changes and resulting cost impacts, which are likely to be passed on to us, cannot be determined with certainty at this time. Our costs of providing these benefits could also increase materially in the future should there be a material reduction in the amount of the recovery of these costs through our rates or should significant delays develop in the timing of the recovery of such costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity.The use of derivative contracts in the normal course of business by the Registrants or Enable could result in financial losses that could negatively impact the Registrants’ results of operations and those of Enable.The Registrants use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, to manage commodity, weather and financial market risks. Enable may also use such instruments from time to time to manage its commodity and financial market risks. The Registrants or Enable could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values or ineffectiveness of these contracts or should a counterparty fail to perform. Additionally, in the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management’s judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.If CenterPoint Energy redeems the ZENS prior to their maturity in 2029, its ultimate tax liability and redemption payments would result in significant cash payments, which would adversely impact its cash flows. Similarly, a significant amount of exchanges of ZENS by ZENS holders could adversely impact CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows. CenterPoint Energy has approximately $828\\xa0million principal amount of ZENS outstanding as of December\\xa031, 2019. CenterPoint Energy owns shares of ZENS-Related Securities equal to approximately 100% of the reference shares used to calculate its obligation to the holders of the ZENS. CenterPoint Energy may redeem all of the ZENS at any time at a redemption amount per ZENS equal to the higher of the contingent principal amount per ZENS ($75 million in the aggregate, or $5.28 per ZENS, as of December\\xa031, 2019) or the sum of the current market value of the reference shares attributable to one ZENS at the time of redemption.  In the event CenterPoint Energy redeems the ZENS, in addition to the redemption amount, it would be required to pay deferred taxes related to the ZENS.  CenterPoint Energy’s ultimate tax liability related to the ZENS continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year. If the ZENS had been redeemed on December\\xa031, 2019, deferred taxes of approximately $429 million would have been payable in 2019, based on 2019 tax rates in effect. In addition, if all the shares of ZENS-Related Securities had been sold on December\\xa031, 2019 to fund the aggregate redemption amount, capital gains taxes of approximately $149 million would have been payable in 2019. Similarly, a significant amount of exchanges of ZENS by ZENS holders could adversely impact CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows. This could happen if CenterPoint Energy’s creditworthiness were to drop or the market for the ZENS were to become illiquid, or for some other reason. While funds for the payment of cash upon exchange of ZENS could be obtained from the sale of the shares of ZENS-Related Securities that CenterPoint Energy owns 27or from other sources, ZENS exchanges result in a cash outflow because tax deferrals related to the ZENS and ZENS-Related Securities shares would typically cease when ZENS are exchanged and ZENS-Related Securities shares are sold.Dividend requirements associated with the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock that CenterPoint Energy issued to fund a portion of the Merger subject it to certain risks.CenterPoint Energy has issued 800,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 19,550,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/20th interest in a share of CenterPoint Energy’s Series B Preferred Stock. Any future payments of cash dividends, and the amount of any cash dividends CenterPoint Energy pays, on the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock will depend on, among other things, its financial condition, capital requirements and results of operations and the ability of our subsidiaries and Enable to distribute cash to CenterPoint Energy, as well as other factors that CenterPoint Energy’s Board of Directors (or an authorized committee thereof) may consider relevant. Any failure to pay scheduled dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock when due would likely have a material adverse impact on the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, Common Stock and CenterPoint Energy’s debt securities and would prohibit CenterPoint Energy, under the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, from paying cash dividends on or repurchasing shares of Common Stock (subject to limited exceptions) until such time as CenterPoint Energy has paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock.The terms of the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock further provide that if dividends on any of the respective shares have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of three or more semi-annual or six or more quarterly dividend periods, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods, the holders of such shares, voting together as a single class with holders of any and all other series of CenterPoint Energy’s capital stock on parity with its Series A Preferred Stock or its Series B Preferred Stock (as to the payment of dividends and amounts payable on liquidation, dissolution or winding up of CenterPoint Energy’s affairs) upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, will be entitled to vote for the election of a total of two additional members of CenterPoint Energy’s Board of Directors, subject to certain terms and limitations.Risk Factors Affecting Electric Generation, Transmission\\xa0and Distribution Businesses (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric)Rate regulation of Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s businesses may delay or deny their ability to earn an expected return and fully recover their costs.Houston Electric’s rates are regulated by certain municipalities and the PUCT and Indiana Electric’s rates are regulated by the IURC. Their rates are set in comprehensive base rate proceedings (i.e., general rate cases) based on an analysis of their invested capital, their expenses and other factors in a designated test year. Each of these rate proceedings is subject to third-party intervention and appeal, and the timing of a general base rate proceeding may be out of Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s control. For Houston Electric, a general base rate proceeding is required 48 months from the date of the order setting rates in its most recent comprehensive rate proceeding, unless the PUCT issues an order extending the deadline to file that general base rate proceeding. For Indiana Electric, a general base rate proceeding is required prior to the expiration of its TDSIC plan, which expires on December 31, 2023. Houston Electric and Indiana Electric can make no assurance that their respective base rate proceedings will result in favorable adjustments to their rates, in full cost recovery or approval of other requested items, including, among other things, capital structure and ROE. Moreover, these base rate proceedings have caused in certain instances, and in the future could cause, Houston Electric and Indiana Electric to recover their investments below their requested levels, below the national average for utilities or below recently approved levels for other utilities in their respective jurisdictions.  For instance, on April 5, 2019, Houston Electric filed its base rate application with the PUCT and the cities in its service area to change its rates, seeking approval for revenue increases of approximately $194 million, excluding a rider to refund approximately $40 million annually over three years. This rate filing was based on a rate base of $6.4 billion, a 50% debt/50% equity capital structure and a 10.4% ROE. Houston Electric also requested a prudency determination on all capital investments made since January 1, 2010; the establishment of a rider to refund approximately $119 million to its customers over three years resulting from the TCJA; updated depreciation rates; and approval to clarify and update various non-rate tariff provisions. After a five-day hearing in June 2019, and following the issuance of a PFD by the administrative law judges who heard the case, the parties entered into a Stipulation and Settlement Agreement. On February 14, 2020, the PUCT approved the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement, which established rates based on a $13 million increase in annual revenues, a capital structure of 42.5% equity/57.5% debt and a 9.4% ROE. The Stipulation and Settlement Agreement requires Houston Electric to file another case within 48 months of the final order and removes the possibility that the deadline would be extended. For more information on Houston Electric’s base rate case, please read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference. 28The rates that Houston Electric and Indiana Electric are allowed to charge may not match their costs at any given time, a situation referred to as “regulatory lag.” For Houston Electric and Indiana Electric, several interim rate adjustment mechanisms have been implemented to reduce the effects of regulatory lag. These adjustment mechanisms are subject to the applicable regulatory body’s approval and are subject to limitations that may reduce Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s ability to adjust rates. For Houston Electric, the DCRF mechanism adjusts an electric utility’s rates for increases in net distribution-invested capital (e.g., distribution plant and distribution-related intangible plant and communication equipment) since its last comprehensive base rate proceeding, but Houston Electric may only make a DCRF filing once per calendar year and not during a comprehensive base rate proceeding.  In connection with the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement, Houston Electric agreed not to file its DCRF in 2020. The TCOS mechanism allows a transmission service provider to update its wholesale transmission rates to reflect changes in transmission-related invested capital, but is only available to Houston Electric twice per calendar year. However, neither of these mechanisms provides for recovery of operations and maintenance expenses.  Similarly, for Indiana Electric, the TDSIC rate mechanism allows electric utilities (that have an IURC-approved seven-year infrastructure improvement plan) to request incremental rate increases every six months to pay for the projects included in that plan, subject to IURC approval. However, the TDSIC allows the utility to recover 80% of the costs as they are incurred, with the remaining costs to be deferred as regulatory assets to be recovered in the next base rate case. TDSIC rate increases are limited to no more than 2% of the utility’s total retail revenues from the prior year. Indiana Electric recovers transmission costs through a FERC-approved formula rate and reflects charges and costs associated with participation in MISO through the MCRA mechanism, which is filed annually. Other non-fuel purchased power costs are recovered annually via the RCRA Mechanism. Electricity suppliers are required to submit energy efficiency plans to the IURC at least once every three years. Indiana Electric recovers program and administrative costs of these plans, including lost revenues and financial incentives, via its annual DSMA mechanism. The DSMA is subject to IURC approval. Houston Electric and Indiana Electric can make no assurance that filings for such mechanisms will result in favorable adjustments to rates or in full cost recovery. Notwithstanding the application of the rate mechanisms discussed above, the regulatory process by which rates are determined is subject to change as a result of the legislative process or rulemaking, as the case may be, and may not always be available or result in rates that will produce recovery of Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s costs or enable them to earn an expected return. In addition, changes to the interim adjustment mechanisms could result in an increase in regulatory lag or otherwise impact Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s ability to recover their costs in a timely manner. Additionally, inherent in the regulatory process is some level of risk that jurisdictional regulatory authorities may initiate investigations of the prudence of operating expenses incurred or capital investments made by Houston Electric or Indiana Electric and deny the full recovery of their cost of service in rates. To the extent the regulatory process does not allow Houston Electric and Indiana Electric to make a full and timely recovery of appropriate costs, their results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Unlike Houston Electric, Indiana Electric must seek approval by the IURC for long-term financing authority and by the FERC for its short-term financing authority. This authority allows Indiana Electric the flexibility to enter into various financing arrangements. In the event that the IURC or the FERC do not approve Indiana Electric’s financing authority, Indiana Electric may not be able to fully execute its financing plans and its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.  Disruptions at power generation facilities owned by third parties could interrupt Houston Electric’s sales of transmission and distribution services.Houston Electric transmits and distributes to customers of REPs electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties. Houston Electric does not own or operate any power generation facilities. If power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate, Houston Electric’s sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted, and its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s revenues and results of operations are seasonal.A significant portion of Houston Electric’s revenues is derived from rates that it collects from each REP based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of such REP. Similarly, Indiana Electric’s revenues are derived from rates it charges its customers to provide electricity. Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage. Houston Electric’s revenues are generally higher during the warmer months. As in certain past years, unusually mild weather in the warmer months could diminish Houston Electric’s results of operations and harm its financial condition. Conversely, as in certain past years, extreme warm weather conditions could increase Houston Electric’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring.29A significant portion of Indiana Electric’s sales are for space heating and cooling. Consequently, as in certain past years, Indiana Electric’s results of operations may be adversely affected by warmer-than-normal heating season weather or colder-than-normal cooling season weather, while more extreme seasonal weather conditions could increase Indiana Electric’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring.Indiana Electric’s execution of its IRP and its regulated power supply operations are subject to various risks, including timely recovery of capital investments, increased costs and facility outages or shutdowns. Indiana requires each electric utility to perform and submit an IRP every three years, unless extended, to the IURC that uses economic modeling to consider the costs and risks associated with available resource options to provide reliable electric service for the next 20-year period on a periodic basis. Indiana Electric’s 2016 IRP modeling projects that the lowest cost and least risk generation portfolio to serve customers over the next 20 years involves retirement of a significant portion of its current generating fleet and replacing that generation capacity with other resources. Implementation of Indiana Electric’s IRP will likely require recovery of new capital investments, as well as costs of retiring the current generation fleet, including any remaining unrecovered costs of retired assets.  In February 2018, as part of its electric generation transition plan, Indiana Electric filed a petition seeking authorization from the IURC to construct a new 700-850 MW natural gas combined cycle generating facility to replace certain existing generation capacity at an approximate cost of $900 million, which included the cost of a new natural gas pipeline to serve the facility, among other things. While the IURC approved the construction of a 50 MW universal solar array and the plan to retrofit its largest, most efficient coal-fired generation unit (Culley Unit 3), the IURC denied Indiana Electric’s request to construct a 700-850 MW natural gas combined cycle generating facility. The IURC urged Indiana Electric to utilize its next IRP planning cycle to evaluate the merits of a more diverse generation portfolio.During the 2019 Indiana legislative session, certain proposed legislation would have prohibited the construction of new generation assets 250 MW or larger until 2021, among other prohibitions, by directing the IURC to not issue any final orders in proceedings requesting such construction. Although this proposed legislation was ultimately defeated, a similar moratorium on the construction of new generation assets in Indiana could be reintroduced in a subsequent legislative session. Legislation has been proposed in 2020 that would require IURC approval to retire coal-fired generation. This legislation, by its terms, would sunset in early 2021 and is not expected to impact Indiana Electric as currently drafted.With respect to its upcoming IRP, Indiana Electric has conducted a request for proposals targeting 10 to 700 MW of capacity and unit-contingent energy and anticipates filing its 2019/2020 IRP in mid-2020. While the IURC does not approve or reject the IRP, the process involves the issuance of a staff report that provides comments on the IRP.  Depending on comments received on the IRP, the filing of any future requests for generating facilities could be delayed. Further, certain legislative activities such as the proposed moratorium in 2019 or other legislation restricting or delaying new generation could negatively affect Indiana Electric’s ability to construct new generation facilities and execution of its capital plan. Even if a generation project is approved, risks associated with the construction of any new generation exist, including the ability to procure resources needed to build at a reasonable cost, scarcity of resources and labor, ability to appropriately estimate costs of new generation, the effects of potential construction delays and cost overruns and the ability to meet capacity requirements. Further, there is no guarantee that the IURC will approve the requests included in any of Indiana Electric’s future filed petitions relating to its IRP.Additionally, Indiana Electric’s generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses, increased purchase power costs and inadvertent releases of coal ash and/or other contaminants with a significant environmental impact. These operational risks can arise from circumstances such as facility shutdowns or malfunctions due to equipment failure or operator error; interruption of fuel supply or increased prices of fuel as contracts expire; disruptions in the delivery of electricity; inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements; labor disputes; or natural disasters, all of which could adversely affect Indiana Electric’s business. Further, Indiana Electric relies on coal for substantially all of its generation capacity. Currently, its coal supply is purchased largely from a single, unrelated party and, although the coal supply is under long-term contract, the loss of this supplier or transportation interruptions could adversely affect Indiana Electric’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Houston Electric and Indiana Electric, as a member of ERCOT and MISO, respectively, could be subject to higher costs for system improvements, as well as fines or other sanctions as a result of mandatory reliability standards.Houston Electric and Indiana Electric are members of ERCOT and MISO, respectively, which serve the electric transmission needs of their applicable regions. As a result of their respective participation in ERCOT and MISO, Houston Electric and Indiana Electric do not have operational control over their transmission facilities and are subject to certain costs for improvements to these regional electric transmission systems. In addition, the FERC has jurisdiction with respect to ensuring the reliability of electric transmission service, including transmission facilities owned by Houston Electric and other utilities within ERCOT and Indiana Electric and other utilities within MISO, respectively. The FERC has designated the NERC as the ERO to promulgate standards, 30under FERC oversight, for all owners, operators and users of the bulk power system. The FERC has approved the delegation by the NERC of authority for reliability in ERCOT to the Texas RE, a Texas non-profit corporation and for reliability in the portion of MISO that includes Indiana Electric to ReliabilityFirst Corporation, a Delaware non-profit corporation. Compliance with mandatory reliability standards may subject Houston Electric and Indiana Electric to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures, which may not be fully recoverable in rates. In addition, if Houston Electric or Indiana Electric were to be found to be in noncompliance with applicable mandatory reliability standards, they could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties. Houston Electric’s receivables are primarily concentrated in a small number of REPs, and any delay or default in such payments could adversely affect Houston Electric’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.Houston Electric’s receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from REPs that supply the electricity Houston Electric distributes to their customers. As of December\\xa031, 2019, Houston Electric did business with approximately 68\\xa0REPs. Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for Houston Electric’s services or could cause them to delay such payments. Houston Electric depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis. Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments. Applicable PUCT regulations significantly limit the extent to which Houston Electric can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory, and Houston Electric thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another REP or the provider of last resort. A significant portion of Houston Electric’s billed receivables from REPs are from affiliates of NRG and Vistra Energy Corp., formerly known as TCEH Corp. Houston Electric’s aggregate billed receivables balance from REPs as of December\\xa031, 2019 was $192 million. Approximately 32% and 12% of this amount was owed by affiliates of NRG and Vistra Energy Corp., respectively.  Any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect Houston Electric’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. If a REP were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations, and claims might be made by creditors involving payments Houston Electric had received from such REP.  Risk Factors Affecting Natural Gas Distribution and Competitive Energy Services Businesses (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)On February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. For further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements.Rate regulation of NGD may delay or deny its ability to earn an expected return and fully recover its costs.NGD’s rates are regulated by certain municipalities (in Texas only) and state commissions based on an analysis of NGD’s invested capital, expenses and other factors in a test year (often either fully or partially historic) in comprehensive base rate proceedings, subject to periodic review and adjustment. Each of these proceedings is subject to third-party intervention and appeal, and the timing of a general base rate proceeding may be out of NGD’s control. NGD has pending, or anticipates the filing of, rate cases in Indiana, Minnesota and Texas during 2020. NGD can make no assurance that these respective base rate proceedings will result in favorable adjustments to its rates, full cost recovery or approval of other requested items, including, among other things, capital structure and ROE. Moreover, these base rate proceedings could cause NGD to recover its investments at rates below its requested level, below the national average for utilities or below recently approved levels for other utilities in those jurisdictions.The rates that NGD is allowed to charge may not match its costs at any given time, resulting in what is referred to as “regulatory lag.” Though several interim rate adjustment mechanisms have been approved by jurisdictional regulatory authorities and implemented by NGD to reduce the effects of regulatory lag, such adjustment mechanisms are subject to the applicable regulatory body’s approval, which we cannot assure would be approved, and are subject to certain limitations that may reduce or otherwise impede NGD’s ability to adjust its rates or result in rates below those requested by NGD.Arkansas allows public utilities to elect to have their rates regulated pursuant to a FRP, providing for a utility’s base rates to be adjusted once a year. In each of Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma, NGD makes annual filings utilizing various formula rate mechanisms that adjust rates based on a comparison of authorized return to actual return to achieve the allowed return rates in those jurisdictions. Additionally, in Minnesota, the MPUC implemented a full revenue decoupling program, which separates approved revenues from the amount of natural gas used by its customers. Further, in Indiana, NGD may file a CSIA every six months to seek rate increases to recover certain federally mandated project costs (e.g., pipeline safety). The TDSIC (recovered 31through the CSIA), allows the utility to recover 80% of its project costs associated with an IURC-approved seven-year infrastructure improvement plan as they are incurred, with the remaining costs to be deferred until the next base rate case, and rate increases are limited to no more than 2% of the utility’s total retail revenues. In Ohio, the DRR is an annual mechanism that allows a utility to recover its investments in utility plant and operating expenses associated with replacing bare steel and cast-iron pipelines, as well as certain other infrastructure investments. The effectiveness of these filings and programs depends on the approval of the applicable state regulatory body. In Texas, NGD’s Houston, South Texas, Beaumont/East Texas and Texas Coast divisions each submit annual GRIP filings to recover the incremental capital investments made in the preceding year until a general rate case is filed. NGD must file a general rate case no later than five and a half years after the initial GRIP implementation date.NGD can make no assurance that filings for such mechanisms will result in favorable adjustments to rates.  Notwithstanding the application of the rate mechanisms discussed above, the regulatory process by which rates are determined is subject to change as a result of the legislative process or rulemaking, as the case may be, and may not always be available or result in rates that will produce recovery of NGD’s costs or enable NGD to earn an expected return. In addition, changes to the interim adjustment mechanisms could result in an increase in regulatory lag or otherwise impact NGD’s ability to recover its costs in a timely manner. Additionally, inherent in the regulatory process is some level of risk that jurisdictional regulatory authorities may initiate investigations of the prudence of operating expenses incurred or capital investments made by NGD and deny the full recovery of NGD’s cost of service or the full recovery of incurred natural gas costs in rates. To the extent the regulatory process does not allow NGD to make a full and timely recovery of appropriate costs, its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.Unlike CERC, Indiana Gas, SIGECO’s natural gas distribution business and VEDO must seek approval by the IURC and PUCO, as applicable, for long-term financing authority. This authority allows these utilities the flexibility to enter into various financing arrangements. In the event that the IURC or PUCO do not approve these utilities’ respective financing authorities, they may not be able to fully execute their financing plans and their respective financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.  Access to natural gas supplies and pipeline transmission and storage capacity are essential components of reliable service for NGD’s customers.NGD depends on third-party service providers to maintain an adequate supply of natural gas and for available storage and intrastate and interstate pipeline capacity to satisfy its customers’ needs, all of which are critical to system reliability. Substantially all of NGD’s natural gas supply is purchased from intrastate and interstate pipelines. If NGD is unable to secure an independent natural gas supply of its own or through its affiliates or if third-party service providers fail to timely deliver natural gas to meet NGD’s requirements, the resulting decrease in natural gas supply in NGD’s service territories could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Additionally, a significant disruption, whether through reduced intrastate and interstate pipeline transmission or storage capacity or other events affecting natural gas supply, including, but not limited to, operational failures, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, acts of terrorism or cyber-attacks or changes in legislative or regulatory requirements, could also adversely affect NGD’s businesses. Further, to the extent that NGD’s natural gas requirements cannot be met through access to or continued use of existing natural gas infrastructure or if additional infrastructure, including onshore and offshore exploration and production facilities, gathering and processing systems and pipeline and storage capacity is not constructed at a rate that satisfies demand, then NGD’s operations could be negatively affected.NGD and CES are subject to fluctuations in notional natural gas prices as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials, which could affect the ability of their suppliers and customers to meet their obligations or otherwise adversely affect their liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. NGD and CES are subject to risk associated with changes in the notional price of natural gas as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials that impact their businesses, including transportation and storage, whether through the use of AMAs or other arrangements. Increases in natural gas prices might affect NGD’s and CES’s ability to collect balances due from their customers and, for NGD, could create the potential for uncollectible accounts expense to exceed the recoverable levels built into tariff rates. In addition, a sustained period of high natural gas prices could (i) decrease demand for natural gas in the areas in which NGD and CES operate, thereby resulting in decreased sales and revenues and (ii) increase the risk that NGD’s and CES’s suppliers or customers fail or are unable to meet their obligations. An increase in natural gas prices would also increase working capital requirements by increasing the investment that must be made to maintain natural gas inventory levels. Additionally, a decrease in natural gas prices could increase the amount of collateral required under hedging arrangements. AMAs may be subject to regulatory approval, and such agreements may not be renewed or may be renewed with less favorable terms.32A decline in CERC’s credit rating could result in CERC having to provide collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or to purchase natural gas, which consequently would increase its cash requirements and adversely affect its financial condition.If CERC’s credit rating were to decline, it might be required to post cash collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or to purchase natural gas. If a credit rating downgrade and the resultant cash collateral requirement were to occur at a time when CERC was experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity, CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.NGD’s and CES’s revenues and results of operations are seasonal.NGD’s and CES’s revenues are primarily derived from natural gas sales. Thus, their revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in natural gas usage, with revenues being higher during the winter months. As in certain past years, unusually mild weather in the winter months could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition. Conversely, as occurred in certain past years, extreme cold weather conditions could increase our results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring.The states in which NGD provides service may, either through legislation or rules, adopt restrictions regarding organization, financing and affiliate transactions that could have significant adverse impacts on NGD’s ability to operate.From time to time, proposals have been put forth in some of the states in which NGD does business to give state regulatory authorities increased jurisdiction and scrutiny over organization, capital structure, intracompany relationships and lines of business that could be pursued by registered holding companies and their affiliates that operate in those states. Some of these frameworks attempt to regulate financing activities, acquisitions and divestitures, and arrangements between the utilities and their affiliates, and to restrict the level of non-utility business that can be conducted within the holding company structure. Additionally, they may impose record-keeping, record access, employee training and reporting requirements related to affiliate transactions and reporting in the event of certain downgrading of the utility’s credit rating.These regulatory frameworks could have adverse effects on NGD’s ability to conduct its utility operations, to finance its business and to provide cost-effective utility service. In addition, if more than one state adopts restrictions on similar activities, it may be difficult for NGD and us to comply with competing regulatory requirements. NGD and CES must compete with alternate energy sources, which could result in less natural gas marketed and have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.NGD and CES compete primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources. In some areas, intrastate pipelines, other natural gas distributors and marketers also compete directly with NGD and CES for natural gas sales to end users. In addition, as a result of federal regulatory changes affecting interstate pipelines, natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be able to bypass NGD’s facilities and market, sell and/or transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial customers. Any reduction in the amount of natural gas marketed, sold or transported by NGD and CES as a result of competition may have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Infrastructure Services’ and ESG’s operations could be adversely affected by a number of factors.Infrastructure Services’ and ESG’s business results are dependent on a number of factors. The industries are competitive and many of the contracts are subject to a bidding process. Should Infrastructure Services and ESG be unsuccessful in bidding contracts (e.g., federal Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts for ESG), results of operations could be impacted. Through competitive bidding, the volume of contracted work could vary significantly from year to year. Further, to the extent there are unanticipated cost increases in completion of the contracted work or issues arise where amounts due for work performed may not be collected, the profit margin realized on any single project could be reduced. Changes in legislation and regulations impacting the sectors in which the customers served by Infrastructure Services or ESG operate could adversely impact operating results. Infrastructure Services enters into a variety of contracts, some of which are fixed price. Other risks that could adversely affect Infrastructure Services include, but are not limited to: failure to properly construct pipeline infrastructure; loss of significant customers or a significant decline in related customer revenues; cancellation of projects by customers and/or reductions in the scope of the projects; changes in the timing of projects; the inability to obtain materials and equipment required to perform services from suppliers and manufacturers; and changes in the market prices of oil and natural gas and state regulatory requirements that mandate pipeline replacement programs that would affect the demand for infrastructure construction and/or the project margin realized on projects. For ESG, other risks include, but are not limited to: discontinuation of the federal ESPC and UESC programs; 33the inability of customers to finance projects; failure to appropriately design, construct or operate projects; and cancellation of projects by customers and/or reductions in the scope of the projects. In addition, Infrastructure Services has supported CenterPoint Energy’s utilities pursuant to service contracts.  In most instances, the ability to maintain these service contracts depends upon regulatory discretion, and there can be no assurance it will be able to obtain future service contracts, or that existing arrangements will not be revisited.On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020.  For further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements.ESG’s business has performance and warranty obligations, some of which are guaranteed by CenterPoint Energy. In the normal course of business, ESG issues performance bonds and other forms of assurance that commit it to operate facilities, pay vendors or subcontractors and support warranty obligations. As the parent company, CenterPoint Energy has and will from time to time guarantee its subsidiaries’ commitments. These guaranties do not represent incremental consolidated obligations; rather, they represent parental guaranties of subsidiary obligations to allow the subsidiary the flexibility to conduct business without posting other forms of collateral.  Neither CenterPoint Energy nor Vectren has been called upon to satisfy any obligations pursuant to these parental guaranties. Risk Factors Affecting CenterPoint Energy’s Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LP (CenterPoint Energy) CenterPoint Energy holds a substantial limited partner interest in Enable (53.7% of the outstanding common units representing limited partner interests in Enable as of December\\xa031, 2019), as well as 50% of the management rights in Enable GP and a 40% interest in the incentive distribution rights held by Enable GP. As of December\\xa031, 2019, CenterPoint Energy owned an aggregate of 14,520,000 Enable Series A Preferred Units representing limited partner interests in Enable.  Accordingly, CenterPoint Energy’s future earnings, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will be affected by the performance of Enable, the amount of cash distributions it receives from Enable and the value of its interests in Enable.  Factors that may have a material impact on Enable’s performance and cash distributions, and, hence, the value of CenterPoint Energy’s interests in Enable, include the risk factors outlined below, as well as the risks described elsewhere under “Risk Factors” that are applicable to Enable.CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows will be adversely impacted if it receives less cash distributions from Enable than it currently expects or if it reduces its ownership in Enable.Both CenterPoint Energy and OGE hold their limited partner interests in Enable in the form of common units. CenterPoint Energy also holds Enable Series A Preferred Units.  For the Enable Series A Preferred Units, Enable is expected to pay $0.625 per Enable Series A Preferred Unit, or $2.50 per Enable Series A Preferred Unit on an annualized basis. However, distributions on each Enable Series A Preferred Unit are not mandatory and are non-cumulative in the event distributions are not declared on the Enable Series A Preferred Units. Enable is expected to pay a minimum quarterly distribution of $0.2875 per unit, or $1.15 per unit on an annualized basis, on its outstanding common units to the extent it has sufficient cash from operations after establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses, including payments to Enable GP and its affiliates (referred to as “available cash”). Enable may not have sufficient available cash each quarter to enable it (i) to pay distributions on the Enable Series A Preferred Units or (ii) maintain or increase the distributions on its common units. Additionally, distributions on the Enable Series A Preferred Units reduce the amount of available cash Enable has to pay distributions on its common units. The amount of cash Enable can distribute on its common units and the Enable Series A Preferred Units will principally depend upon the amount of cash it generates from its operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:•the fees and gross margins it realizes with respect to the volume of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil that it handles;•the prices of, levels of production of, and demand for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;•the volume of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil it gathers, compresses, treats, dehydrates, processes, fractionates, transports and stores;•the relationship among prices for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;•cash calls and settlements of hedging positions;•margin requirements on open price risk management assets and liabilities;34•the level of competition from other companies offering midstream services;•adverse effects of governmental and environmental regulation;•the level of its operation and maintenance expenses and general and administrative costs; and•prevailing economic conditions.In addition, the actual amount of cash Enable will have available for distribution will depend on other factors, including:•the level and timing of its capital expenditures;•the cost of acquisitions;•its debt service requirements and other liabilities;•fluctuations in its working capital needs;•its ability to borrow funds and access capital markets;•restrictions contained in its debt agreements;•the amount of cash reserves established by Enable GP; •distributions paid on the Enable Series A Preferred Units; •any impact on cash levels should any sale of CenterPoint Energy’s investment in Enable occur, as discussed further below; and•other business risks affecting its cash levels. Additionally, although it has no current plan to do so, CenterPoint Energy may also reduce its ownership in Enable over time through sales in the public equity markets, or otherwise, of the Enable common units it holds, subject to market conditions. CenterPoint Energy’s ability to execute any sale of Enable common units is subject to a number of uncertainties, including the timing, pricing and terms of any such sale.  Any sales of Enable common units CenterPoint Energy owns could have an adverse impact on the price of Enable common units or on any trading market for Enable common units. Further, CenterPoint Energy’s sales of Enable common units may have an adverse impact on Enable’s ability to issue equity on satisfactory terms, or at all, which may limit its ability to expand operations or make future acquisitions. Any reduction in CenterPoint Energy’s interest in Enable would result in decreased distributions from Enable and decrease income, which may adversely impact CenterPoint Energy’s ability to meet its payment obligations and pay dividends on its Common Stock. Further, any sales of Enable common units would result in a significant amount of taxes due, which could also significantly impact CenterPoint Energy’s determination to execute any sale. There can be no assurances that any sale of Enable common units in the public equity markets or otherwise will be completed. Any sale of Enable common units in the public equity markets or otherwise may involve significant costs and expenses, including, in connection with any public offering, a significant underwriting discount.  CenterPoint Energy may not realize any or all of the anticipated strategic, financial, operational or other benefits from any completed sale or reduction in its investment in Enable. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, including following certain changes in the methodology employed by rating agencies whereby the Enable Series A Preferred Units are no longer eligible for the same or a higher amount of “equity credit” attributed to the Enable Series A Preferred Units on their original issue date (referred to as a “rating event”), Enable has the option to redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units. There can be no assurances that CenterPoint Energy will be able to reinvest any proceeds from such redemption in a manner that provides for a similar rate of return as the Enable Series A Preferred Units.35The amount of cash Enable has available for distribution to CenterPoint Energy on its common units and the Enable Series A Preferred Units depends primarily on its cash flow rather than on its profitability, which may prevent Enable from making distributions, even during periods in which Enable records net income.The amount of cash Enable has available for distribution on its common units and the Enable Series A Preferred Units, depends primarily upon its cash flows and not solely on profitability, which will be affected by non-cash items. As a result, Enable may make cash distributions during periods when it records losses for financial accounting purposes and may not make cash distributions during periods when it records net earnings for financial accounting purposes.Enable is required to, or may at its option, redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units in certain circumstances, and Enable may not have sufficient funds to redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units if required to do so.As a holder of the Enable Series A Preferred Units, CenterPoint Energy may request that Enable list those units for trading on the NYSE. If Enable is unable to list the Enable Series A Preferred Units in certain circumstances, it will be required to redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units. There can be no assurance that Enable would have sufficient financial resources available to satisfy its obligation to redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units. In addition, mandatory redemption of the Enable Series A Preferred Units could have a material adverse effect on Enable’s business, financial position, results of operations and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders.Additionally, Enable may redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units under certain circumstances, including following a rating event. Upon a rating event, the Enable Series A Preferred Units may be considered by Enable to be an expensive form of indebtedness.  If Enable does not have sufficient funds to exercise its option to redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units upon a rating event, then such inability could have a material adverse effect on Enable’s business, financial position, results of operations and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders.CenterPoint Energy is not able to exercise control over Enable, which entails certain risks.Enable is controlled jointly by CenterPoint Energy and OGE, who each own 50% of the management rights in Enable GP.  The board of directors of Enable GP is composed of an equal number of directors appointed by OGE and by CenterPoint Energy, the president and chief executive officer of Enable GP and three directors who are independent as defined under the independence standards established by the NYSE.  Accordingly, CenterPoint Energy is not able to exercise control over Enable.Although CenterPoint Energy jointly controls Enable with OGE, CenterPoint Energy may have conflicts of interest with Enable that could subject it to claims that CenterPoint Energy has breached its fiduciary duty to Enable and its unitholders.CenterPoint Energy and OGE each own 50% of the management rights in Enable GP, as well as limited partner interests in Enable, and interests in the incentive distribution rights held by Enable GP.  CenterPoint Energy also holds Enable Series A Preferred Units. Conflicts of interest may arise between CenterPoint Energy and Enable and its unitholders. CenterPoint Energy’s joint control of Enable GP may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary or contractual duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to Enable. In resolving these conflicts, CenterPoint Energy may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the interests of Enable and its unitholders as long as the resolution does not conflict with Enable’s partnership agreement. These circumstances could subject CenterPoint Energy to claims that, in favoring its own interests and those of its affiliates, CenterPoint Energy breached a fiduciary or contractual duty to Enable or its unitholders.Enable is subject to various operational risks, all of which could affect Enable’s ability to make cash distributions to CenterPoint Energy. The execution of Enable’s businesses is subject to a number of operational risks, which include, but are not limited to, the following: •Contract Renewal: Enable’s contracts are subject to renewal risks. To the extent Enable is unable to renew or replace its expiring contracts on terms that are favorable, if at all, or successfully manage its overall contract mix over time, its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected;•Customers: Enable depends on a small number of customers for a significant portion of its gathering and processing revenues and its transportation and storage revenues. The loss of, or reduction in volumes from, these customers or the failure to extend or replace these contracts or the extension or replacement of these contracts on less favorable terms, as a result of competition or otherwise, could result in a decline in sales of its gathering and processing or transportation 36and storage services and adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions;•Third-Party Drilling and Production Decisions: Enable’s businesses are dependent, in part, on the natural gas and crude oil drilling and production market conditions and decisions of others, over which Enable has no control. Further, sustained reductions in exploration or production activity in Enable’s areas of operation and fluctuations in energy prices could lead to further reductions in the utilization of Enable’s systems, which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions. It may also become more difficult to maintain or increase the current volumes on Enable’s gathering systems and in its processing plants, as several of the formations in the unconventional resource plays in which it operates generally have higher initial production rates and steeper production decline curves than wells in more conventional basins. Should Enable determine that the economics of its gathering assets do not justify the capital expenditures needed to grow or maintain volumes associated therewith, Enable may reduce such capital expenditures, which could cause revenues associated with these assets to decline over time; •Competition: Enable competes with similar enterprises, some of which include public and private energy companies with greater financial resources and access to natural gas, NGL and crude oil supplies, in its respective areas of operation, primarily through rates, terms of service and flexibility and reliability of service. Increased competitive pressure in Enable’s industry, which is already highly competitive, could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions; •Cost Recovery of Capital Improvements: Enable may not be able to recover the costs of its substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions, and the actual cost of such improvements and additions may be significantly higher than it anticipates. In Enable’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December\\xa031, 2019, Enable stated that it expects that its expansion capital could range from approximately $160\\xa0million to $240 million and its maintenance capital could range from approximately $110\\xa0million to $130\\xa0million for the year ending December 31, 2020; •Commodity Prices: Natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices are volatile, and changes in these prices could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions. Factors affecting prices are beyond Enable’s control and include the following: (i) demand for these commodities, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors, including the impact of seasonality and weather, general economic conditions, the level of domestic and offshore natural gas production and consumption, (ii) the availability of imported natural gas, LNG, NGLs and crude oil, (iii) actions taken by foreign natural gas and oil producing nations, (iv) the availability of local, intrastate and interstate transportation systems, (v) the availability and marketing of competitive fuels, (vi) the impact of energy conservation efforts, technological advances affecting energy consumption and (vii) the extent of governmental regulation and taxation. Further, Enable’s natural gas processing arrangements expose it to commodity price fluctuations. In 2019, 4%, 26% and 70% of Enable’s processing plant inlet volumes consisted of keep-whole arrangements, percent-of-proceeds or percent-of-liquids and fee-based, respectively. If the price at which Enable sells natural gas or NGLs is less than the cost at which Enable purchases natural gas or NGLs under these arrangements, then Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected; •Credit Risk of Customers: Enable is exposed to credit risks of its customers, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by its customers, whether through severe financial problems or otherwise, could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions; •“Negotiated Rate” Contracts: Enable provides certain transportation and storage services under fixed-price “negotiated rate” contracts, which are authorized by the FERC, that are not subject to adjustment, even if its cost to perform these services exceeds the revenues received from these contracts. As of December\\xa031, 2019, approximately 37% of Enable’s aggregate contracted firm transportation capacity on EGT and MRT and 93% of its aggregate contracted firm storage capacity on EGT and MRT, was subscribed under such “negotiated rate” contracts. The majority of Enable’s aggregate contracted firm transportation capacity and all of its aggregate contracted firm storage capacity under negotiated rate contracts on MRT are subject to the FERC’s rate case approval. As a result, Enable’s costs could exceed its revenues received under these contracts, and if Enable’s costs increase and it is not able to recover any shortfall of revenue associated with its negotiated rate contracts, the cash flow realized by its systems could decrease and, therefore, the cash Enable has available for distribution could also decrease; 37•Unavailability of Interconnected Facilities: If third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to Enable’s gathering, processing or transportation facilities (including those providing transportation of natural gas and crude oil, transportation and fractionation of NGLs and electricity for compression, among other things) become partially or fully unavailable for any reason, Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected; and •Land Ownership: Enable does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities are located, and it is therefore subject to the possibility of more onerous terms and/or increased costs to retain necessary land use if it does not have valid rights-of-way or if such rights-of-way lapse or terminate, which could disrupt its operations or result in increased costs related to the construction and continuing operations elsewhere and adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions. Enable conducts a portion of its operations through joint ventures, which subject it to additional risks that could adversely affect the success of these operations and Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.Enable conducts a portion of its operations through joint ventures with third parties, including Enbridge Inc., DCP Midstream, LP, CVR Energy, Inc., Trans Louisiana Gas Pipeline, Inc. and Pablo Gathering LLC. Enable may also enter into other joint venture arrangements in the future. These third parties may have obligations that are important to the success of the joint venture, such as the obligation to pay their share of capital and other costs of the joint venture. Enable’s joint venture arrangements may involve risks not otherwise present when operating assets directly, including, for example:•Enable shares certain approval rights over major decisions and may not be able to control decisions, including control of cash distributions to Enable from the joint venture;•Enable may incur liabilities as a result of an action taken by its joint venture partners, including leaving Enable liable for the other joint venture partners’ shares of joint venture liabilities if those partners do not pay their share of the joint venture’s obligations;•Enable may be required to devote significant management time to the requirements of and matters relating to the joint ventures;•Enable’s insurance policies may not fully cover loss or damage incurred by both Enable and its joint venture partners in certain circumstances;•Enable’s joint venture partners may take actions contrary to its instructions or requests or contrary to its policies or objectives; and•disputes between Enable and its joint venture partners may result in delays, litigation or operational impasses.The risks described above or the failure to continue Enable’s joint ventures or to resolve disagreements with its joint venture partners could adversely affect its ability to transact the business that is the subject of such joint venture, which would in turn adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions. The agreements under which Enable formed certain joint ventures may subject it to various risks, limit the actions it may take with respect to the assets subject to the joint venture and require Enable to grant rights to its joint venture partners that could limit its ability to benefit fully from future positive developments. Some joint ventures require Enable to make significant capital expenditures. If Enable does not timely meet its financial commitments or otherwise does not comply with its joint venture agreements, its rights to participate, exercise operator rights or otherwise influence or benefit from the joint venture may be adversely affected. Certain of Enable’s joint venture partners may have substantially greater financial resources than Enable has and Enable may not be able to secure the funding necessary to participate in operations its joint venture partners propose, thereby reducing its ability to benefit from the joint venture.Under certain circumstances, Enbridge Inc. could have the right to purchase Enable’s ownership interest in SESH at fair market value. Enable owns a 50% ownership interest in SESH. The remaining 50% ownership interest is held by Enbridge Inc. CenterPoint Energy owns 53.7% of Enable’s common units, 100% of the Enable Series A Preferred Units and a 40% economic interest in Enable GP. Pursuant to the terms of the limited liability company agreement of SESH, as amended, if, at any time, CenterPoint 38Energy has a right to receive less than 50% of Enable’s distributions through its interests in Enable and Enable GP, or do not have the ability to exercise certain control rights, Enbridge Inc. could have the right to purchase Enable’s interest in SESH at fair market value, subject to certain exceptions.Enable’s ability to grow is dependent in part on its ability to access external financing sources on acceptable terms.Enable expects that it will distribute all of its “available cash” to its unitholders.  As a result, Enable is expected to rely significantly upon external financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures. To the extent Enable is unable to finance growth externally or through internally generated cash flows, Enable’s cash distribution policy may significantly impair its ability to grow. In addition, because Enable is expected to distribute all of its available cash, its growth may not be as fast as businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations.To the extent Enable issues additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures, the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that Enable will be unable to maintain or increase its per unit distribution level, which in turn may impact the available cash that it has to distribute on each unit. There are no limitations in Enable’s partnership agreement on its ability to issue additional units, including units ranking senior to the common units. The incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt by Enable to finance its growth strategy would result in increased interest expense, which in turn may negatively impact the available cash that Enable has to distribute to its unitholders.Enable depends, in part, on access to the capital markets and other external financing sources to fund its expansion capital expenditures, although it has also increasingly relied on cash flow generated from operations. Historically, unit prices of midstream master limited partnerships have experienced periods of volatility. In addition, because Enable’s common units are yield-based securities, rising market interest rates could impact the relative attractiveness of its common units to investors. As a result of capital market volatility, Enable may be unable to issue equity or debt on satisfactory terms, or at all, which may limit its ability to expand its operations or make future acquisitions.Enable’s debt levels may limit its flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities.As of December 31, 2019, Enable had approximately $4.0 billion of long-term debt outstanding, excluding the premiums, discounts and unamortized debt expense on their senior notes, $155 million outstanding under its commercial paper program and $250 million outstanding under the Enable Oklahoma Intrastate Transmission, LLC 6.25% senior notes due 2020, excluding unamortized premium. Enable has a $1.75 billion revolving credit facility for working capital, capital expenditures and other partnership purposes, including acquisitions, with no borrowings outstanding, of which approximately $1.59 billion in borrowing capacity was available as of December 31, 2019. As of January 31, 2020, Enable had $119 million outstanding under its commercial paper program and $1.63 billion of available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility. Enable has the ability to incur additional debt, subject to limitations in its credit facilities. The levels of Enable’s debt could have important consequences, including the following:•the ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or the financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all;•a portion of cash flows will be required to make interest payments on the debt, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations, future business opportunities and distributions;•Enable’s debt level will make it more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in its business or the economy generally; and•Enable’s debt level may limit its flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions.Enable’s ability to service its debt will depend upon, among other things, its future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions, commodity prices and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond Enable’s control. If operating results are not sufficient to service current or future indebtedness, Enable may be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions, reducing or delaying business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing debt, or seeking additional equity capital. These actions may not be effected on satisfactory terms, or at all.Further, any reductions in Enable’s credit ratings could increase its financing costs and the cost of maintaining certain contractual relationships. Enable cannot assure that its credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a 39rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. If any of Enable’s credit ratings are below investment grade, it may have higher future borrowing costs, and Enable or its subsidiaries may be required to post cash collateral or letters of credit under certain contractual agreements. If cash collateral requirements were to occur at a time when Enable was experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity, its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected.Enable’s credit facilities contain operating and financial restrictions, including covenants and restrictions that may be affected by events beyond Enable’s control, which could adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions.Enable’s credit facilities contain customary covenants that, among other things, limit its ability to:•permit its subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional debt;•incur or permit to exist certain liens on assets;•dispose of assets;•merge or consolidate with another company or engage in a change of control;•enter into transactions with affiliates on non-arm’s length terms; and•change the nature of its business.Enable’s credit facilities also require it to maintain certain financial ratios. Enable’s ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond its control, and we cannot assure you that it will meet those ratios. In addition, Enable’s credit facilities contain events of default customary for agreements of this nature.Enable’s ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in its credit facilities may be affected by events beyond its control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, Enable’s ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. If Enable violates any of the restrictions, covenants, ratios or tests in its credit facilities, a significant portion of its indebtedness may become immediately due and payable. In addition, Enable’s lenders’ commitments to make further loans to it under the revolving credit facility may be suspended or terminated. Enable might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.Enable’s businesses are exposed to various regulatory risks.  Enable’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local regulatory authorities. Changes or additional regulatory measures adopted by such authorities could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions. This regulation includes, but is not limited to, the following:  •Rate Regulation: The rates charged by several of Enable’s pipeline systems, including for interstate gas transportation service provided by its intrastate pipelines, are regulated by the FERC. Enable’s pipeline operations that are not regulated by the FERC may be subject to state and local regulation applicable to intrastate natural gas transportation services and crude oil gathering services. The FERC and state regulatory agencies also regulate other terms and conditions of the services Enable may offer. If one of these regulatory agencies, on its own initiative or due to challenges by third parties, were to lower its tariff rates or deny any rate increase or other material changes to the types, or terms and conditions, of service Enable might propose or offer, the profitability of Enable’s pipeline businesses could suffer.•FERC Revised Policy Statement and NOPR: In a series of related issuances on March 15, 2018, the FERC issued a Revised Policy Statement stating that it will no longer permit pipelines organized as MLPs to recover an income tax allowance in their cost-of-service rates. On July 18, 2018, FERC issued a Final Rule adopting procedures that are generally the same as proposed in a March 15, 2018 NOPR implementing the Revised Policy Statement and the corporate income tax rate reduction with certain clarifications and modifications. For more information, please read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference. If FERC requires Enable to establish new tariff rates for either its natural gas or crude oil pipelines that reflect a lower federal corporate income tax rate, it is possible the rates would be reduced, which could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders. With regard to FERC-jurisdictional 40rates on Enable’s crude oil pipelines, the FERC plans to address the Revised Policy Statement and corporate tax rate reduction in its next five-year review of the oil pipeline rate index, which will occur in 2020 and become effective July 1, 2021. The potential rate impacts from the revision are currently uncertain. •Permits, Licenses and Approvals: Enable may be unable to obtain or renew federal or state permits, licenses or approvals necessary for its operations, which could inhibit its ability to do business. All of these permits, licenses, approval limits and standards require a significant amount of monitoring, record keeping and reporting to demonstrate compliance with the underlying permit, license, approval limit or standard. Noncompliance or incomplete documentation of Enable’s compliance status may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive relief. Further, to obtain new permits or renew permits and other approvals in the future, Enable may be required to prepare and present data to governmental authorities pertaining to potential adverse impact of a proposed project. Compliance with these regulatory requirements may be expensive and may significantly lengthen the time required to prepare applications and to receive authorizations and consequently could disrupt Enable’s project construction schedules; •Hydraulic Fracturing Regulation: Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing and waste water injection wells could result in reductions or delays in natural gas or crude oil production by Enable’s customers, which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions; and •Jurisdictional Characterization of Assets: Enable’s natural gas gathering and intrastate transportation systems are generally exempt from the jurisdiction of the FERC under the NGA, and its crude oil gathering system in the Anadarko Basin is generally exempt from the jurisdiction of the FERC under ICA. FERC regulation may indirectly impact these businesses and the markets for products derived from these businesses. Natural gas gathering and intrastate crude oil gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at the state level; therefore, Enable’s operations could be adversely affected should they become subject to the application of state regulation of rates and services. A change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of Enable’s assets by federal, state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of its assets, which may cause its revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase.Other Risk Factors Affecting Our Businesses and/or CenterPoint Energy’s Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LPThe success of the Merger depends, in part, on CenterPoint Energy’s ability to realize anticipated benefits and conduct an effective integration process. The success of the Merger will depend, in part, on CenterPoint Energy’s ability to realize the expected benefits in the anticipated timeframe, including operating efficiencies, growth opportunities, cost savings and customer retention, from integrating CenterPoint Energy’s and Vectren’s businesses, while at the same time continuing to provide consistent, high quality services. The integration process could be complex, costly and time consuming, including the diversion of significant management time and resources thereto, and may result in the following challenges, among other things: •unanticipated delays, disruptions, issues or costs in integrating operations, financial and accounting, information technology, communications and other systems;  •inconsistencies in procedures, practices, policies, controls, and standards;  •differences in compensation arrangements, management perspectives and corporate culture; and  •loss of or difficulties retaining talented employees or valuable third-party relationships.  CenterPoint Energy must also successfully adapt its systems of internal controls to continue to accurately provide reliable financial reports, including reporting of its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, effectively prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If CenterPoint Energy’s efforts to maintain an effective system of internal controls throughout integration are not successful, it is unable to maintain adequate controls over its financial reporting and processes in the future or it is unable to comply with its obligations under Section\\xa0404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, CenterPoint Energy’s operating results could be harmed or it may fail to meet its reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls also could cause investors to lose confidence in CenterPoint Energy’s reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading prices of its securities. \\xa041Even with the successful integration of the businesses, CenterPoint Energy may not achieve the expected results or economic benefits, including any expected revenue or synergy opportunities. Failure to fully realize the anticipated benefits could adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Cyber-attacks, physical security breaches, acts of terrorism or other disruptions could adversely impact our or Enable’s reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.We and Enable are subject to cyber and physical security risks related to adversaries attacking information technology systems, network infrastructure, technology and facilities used to conduct almost all of our and Enable’s business, which includes, among other things, (i) managing operations and other business processes and (ii) protecting sensitive information maintained in the normal course of business. For example, the operation of our electric generation, transmission and distribution systems are dependent on not only physical interconnection of our facilities but also on communications among the various components of our systems and third-party systems. This reliance on information and communication between and among those components has increased since deployment of the intelligent grid, smart devices and operational technologies across our businesses.\\xa0Further, certain of the various internal systems we use to conduct our businesses are highly integrated. Consequently, a cyber-attack or unauthorized access in any one of these systems could potentially impact the other systems. Similarly, our and Enable’s business operations are interconnected with external networks and facilities. The distribution of natural gas to our customers requires communications with Enable’s pipeline facilities and third-party systems. The gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas from Enable’s gathering,\\xa0processing and pipeline facilities and crude oil gathering pipeline systems also rely on communications among its facilities and with third-party systems that may be delivering natural gas or crude oil into or receiving natural gas or crude oil and other products from Enable’s facilities. Disruption of those communications, whether caused by physical disruption such as storms or other natural disasters, by failure of equipment or technology or by manmade events, such as cyber-attacks or acts of terrorism, may disrupt our or Enable’s ability to conduct operations and control assets.Cyber-attacks, including phishing attacks and threats from the use of malicious code such as malware, ransomware and viruses, and unauthorized access could also result in the loss, or unauthorized use, of confidential, proprietary or critical infrastructure data or security breaches of other information technology systems that could disrupt operations and critical business functions, adversely affect reputation, increase costs and subject us or Enable to possible legal claims and liability. Further, third parties, including vendors, suppliers and contractors, who perform certain services for us or administer and maintain our sensitive information, could also be targets of cyber-attacks and unauthorized access. Neither we nor Enable are fully insured against all cyber-security risks, any of which could adversely affect our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on either our or Enable’s results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.As domestic and global cyber threats are on-going and increasing in sophistication, magnitude and frequency, our and Enable’s critical energy infrastructure may be targets of state-sponsored attacks, terrorist activities or otherwise that could disrupt our respective business operations. Any such disruptions could result in significant costs to repair damaged facilities, restore service  and implement increased security measures, which could have a material adverse effect on either our or Enable’s results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect us.In connection with our businesses, we and our vendors, suppliers and contractors collect and retain personally identifiable information (e.g., information of our customers, shareholders, suppliers and employees), and there is an expectation that we and such third parties will adequately protect that information. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and data privacy is increasingly demanding. New laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and elevate our costs. Any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations, including as a result of a security or privacy breach, could result in significant costs, fines and penalties and liabilities for us. A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of the personally identifiable information we maintain or failure of our vendors, suppliers and contractors to use or maintain such data in accordance with contractual provisions and other legal requirements could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs, fines and penalties and liabilities for us. Additionally, if we acquire a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws, we may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result.We are subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities arising from environmental laws and regulations.Our operations and the operations of Enable are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to the environment. As an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines, distribution systems and storage, steam electric generating facilities 42and electric transmission and distribution systems, and the facilities that support these systems, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as:•restricting the way we manage hazardous and non-hazardous wastes, including wastewater discharges and air emissions;•limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, coastal regions, or areas inhabited by endangered species;•requiring remedial action and monitoring to mitigate environmental conditions caused by our operations, or attributable to former operations;•limiting airborne emissions from electric generating facilities, including particulate matter, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon dioxide (CO2) and mercury, and the disposal non-hazardous substances such as CCRs, among other things; •restricting the use of fossil fuels through future climate legislation or regulation;•imposing requirements on or restricting the operations of facilities under the terms of permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations; and•impacting the demand for our services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of fossil fuels, including, but not limited to, natural gas.To comply with these requirements, we may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to:•construct or acquire new facilities and equipment;•acquire permits for facility operations or purchase emissions allowances;•modify or replace existing and proposed equipment; and•decommission or remediate waste management areas, fuel storage facilities and other locations.Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, revocation of permits, the imposition of remedial actions, and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean, restore and monitor sites where hazardous substances have been stored, disposed or released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment.In April 2015, the EPA finalized its CCR Rule, which regulates ash as non\\xad‑hazardous material under the RCRA. Under the CCR Rule, Indiana Electric is required to complete integrity assessments and groundwater monitoring studies. In January 2018, Indiana Electric completed its first annual groundwater monitoring and corrective action report. This report identified localized impacts to groundwater near Indiana Electric’s coal impoundments. Further analysis is ongoing. In October 2018, Indiana Electric completed the CCR Rule’s required evaluation of the placement of Indiana Electric’s coal ash ponds. Indiana Electric completed its evaluation and determined that one F.B. Culley pond (Culley East) and the A.B. Brown pond fail the aquifer placement location restriction. As a result of this failure, Indiana Electric must cease disposal of new ash in the ponds and commence closure of the ponds by August 31, 2020. Indiana Electric plans to seek extensions available under the CCR Rule that would allow it to continue to use the ponds through December 31, 2023. The inability to obtain these extensions may result in increased and potentially significant operational costs in connection with the accelerated implementation of an alternative ash disposal system or adversely impact Indiana Electric’s future operations. Failure to comply with these requirements could also result in an enforcement proceeding including imposition of fines and penalties. Further, a release of coal ash that presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to health of the environment could result in remediation costs, civil and/or criminal penalties, claims, litigation, increased regulation and compliance costs and reputational damage, all of which could adversely affect the financial condition of Indiana Electric. 43The recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment, and thus there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be greater than the amounts we currently\\xa0anticipate. Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient. Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We currently have insurance in place, such as general liability and property insurance, to cover certain of our facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of our facilities may not be sufficient to fully cover or restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Costs, damages and other liabilities related to recent events and incidents that affected other utilities, such as wildfires and explosions, among other things, have exceeded or could exceed such utilities’ insurance coverage. Further, as a result of these recent events and incidents, the marketplace for insurance coverage may be unavailable or limited in capacity or any such available coverage may be deemed by us to be cost prohibitive under current conditions. Any such coverage, if available, may not be eligible for recovery, whether in full or in part, by us through the rates charged by our utility businesses.In common with other companies in its line of business that serve coastal regions, Houston Electric does not have insurance covering its transmission and distribution system, other than substations, because Houston Electric believes it to be cost prohibitive and believes insurance capacity to be limited. Historically, Houston Electric has been able to recover the costs incurred in restoring its transmission and distribution properties following hurricanes or other disasters through issuance of storm restoration bonds or a change in its regulated rates or otherwise.  In the future, any such recovery may not be granted. Therefore, Houston Electric may not be able to restore any loss of, or damage to, any of its transmission and distribution properties without negative impact on its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our operations and Enable’s operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards inherent in their respective businesses of gathering, processing, transportation and storage of natural gas and crude oil and the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, including:•damage to pipelines and plants, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires, earthquakes and other natural disasters, acts of terrorism and actions by third parties; •inadvertent damage from construction, vehicles and farm and utility equipment; •leaks of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and other hydrocarbons or losses of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities; •ruptures, fires and explosions; and •other safety hazards affecting our operations. These risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury and/or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage. These risks may also result in curtailment or suspension of our or Enable’s operations. A natural disaster or other hazard affecting the areas in which we or Enable operate could have a material adverse effect on our or Enable’s operations.Enable is not fully insured against all risks inherent in its business. Enable currently has general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of its facilities in amounts that Enable considers appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles. Enable does not have business interruption insurance coverage for all of its operations. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of Enable’s facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on its results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions. 44Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully operate our facilities or perform certain corporate functions.Our performance depends on the successful operation of our facilities. Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:•operator error or failure of equipment or processes, including failure to follow appropriate safety protocols;•the handling of hazardous equipment or materials that could result in serious personal injury, loss of life and environmental and property damage;•operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements;•labor disputes; •information technology or financial and billing system failures, including those due to the implementation and integration of new technology, that impair our information technology infrastructure, reporting systems or disrupt normal business operations;•information technology failure that affects our ability to access customer information or causes us to lose confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects our reputation or exposes us to legal claims; and•catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, leaks, floods, droughts, hurricanes, ice storms, terrorism, wildfires, pandemic health events or other similar occurrences, including any environmental impacts related thereto, which catastrophic events may require participation in mutual assistance efforts by us or other utilities to assist in power restoration efforts.Such events may result in a decrease or elimination of revenue from our facilities, an increase in the cost of operating our facilities or delays in cash collections, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Our and Enable’s success depends upon our and Enable’s ability to attract, effectively transition, motivate and retain key employees and identify and develop talent to succeed senior management.We and Enable depend on senior executive officers and other key personnel. Our and Enable’s success depends on our and Enable’s ability to attract, effectively transition and retain key personnel. On February 19, 2020, our president and chief executive officer resigned from CenterPoint Energy. As a result of this departure, our board of directors is currently conducting a search to fill the role of chief executive officer. The inability to recruit and retain or effectively transition key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our and Enable’s operations. In addition, because of the reliance on our and Enable’s management team, our and Enable’s future success depends in part on our and Enable’s ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management. The retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be critically important to the successful implementation of our and Enable’s strategies.Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could adversely impact our and Enable’s results of operations.Our and Enable’s businesses are dependent on recruiting, retaining and motivating employees. Certain circumstances, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, a mismatch of existing skillsets to future needs, or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as a lack of resources, loss of knowledge or a lengthy time period associated with skill development. Our and Enable’s costs, including costs to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our and Enable’s businesses. If we and Enable are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our and Enable’s results of operations could be negatively affected. Climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our or Enable’s services, including certain local initiatives to prohibit new NGD service and increase electrification initiatives.Regulatory agencies have adopted, and from time to time consider adopting, new legislation and/or modifying existing laws and regulations, to reduce GHGs, and there continues to be a wide-ranging policy and regulatory debate, both nationally and 45internationally, regarding the potential impact of GHGs and possible means for their regulation.\\xa0\\xa0Efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues.In August 2018, the EPA proposed a CPP replacement rule, the ACE Rule, which was finalized in July 2019 and requires states to implement a program of energy efficiency improvement targets for individual coal-fired electric generating units. States have three years to develop state plans to implement the ACE Rule, and we do not expect a state ACE plan to be finalized and approved by the EPA until 2024. We are currently unable to predict the effect of a state plan to implement the ACE Rule but do not anticipate that such a plan would have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Additionally, the ACE Rule is currently subject to legal challenges.  At this time, we are unable to determine what effect, if any, the legal challenges will have on the ACE Rule.\\xa0Following a finding by the EPA that certain GHGs represent an endangerment to human health, the EPA adopted two sets of rules regulating GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act, one that requires a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and another that regulates emissions of GHGs from certain large stationary sources. The EPA has also expanded its existing GHG emissions reporting requirements. These permitting and reporting requirements could lead to further regulation of GHGs by the EPA.\\xa0As a distributor and transporter of natural gas, or a consumer of natural gas in its pipeline and gathering businesses, NGD’s or Enable’s revenues, operating costs and capital requirements, as applicable, could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas.\\xa0Additionally, Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s transmission and distribution businesses’ revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within its service territory. Likewise, incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our services. For further discussion, see “— Risk Factors Affecting Natural Gas Distribution and Competitive Energy Services Businesses —NGD and CES must compete with alternate energy sources, which could result in less natural gas marketed and have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.”Moreover, evolving investor sentiment related to the use of fossil fuels and initiatives to restrict continued production of fossil fuels may have substantial impacts on CenterPoint Energy’s electric generation and NGD businesses. For example, because Indiana Electric’s current generating facilities substantially rely on coal for their operations, certain financial institutions choose not to participate in CenterPoint Energy’s financing arrangements. Also, certain cities in CenterPoint Energy’s NGD operational footprint have adopted initiatives to prohibit the construction of new NGD facilities that would provide service and focus on electrification. For example, Minneapolis has adopted carbon emission reduction goals in an effort to decrease reliance on fossil gas. Also, Minnesota cities may consider seeking legislative authority for the ability to enact voluntary enhanced energy standards for all development projects. Any such initiatives and legislation could adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s results of operations.Climate changes could adversely impact financial results from our and Enable’s businesses and result in more frequent and more severe weather events that could adversely affect the results of operations of our businesses.A changing climate creates uncertainty and could result in broad changes, both physical and financial in nature, to our service territories. If climate changes occur\\xa0that result in warmer temperatures in our service territories, financial results from our and Enable’s businesses could be adversely impacted. For example, NGD could be adversely affected through lower natural gas sales and Enable’s natural gas gathering, processing and transportation and crude oil gathering businesses could experience lower revenues. Another possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes or ice storms.\\xa0\\xa0Since many of our facilities are located along or near the Gulf Coast, increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers.\\xa0\\xa0When we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services, our financial results can be impacted by lost revenues, and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs.\\xa0To the extent we are unable to recover those costs, or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for our services, our future financial results may be adversely impacted. Any such decreased energy use may also require us to retire current infrastructure that is no longer needed. Further, we may be subject to climate change lawsuits, which could result in substantial penalties or damages. NGD and Enable may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairs. Certain of NGD’s and Enable’s pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety laws and regulations. The DOT’s PHMSA has adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections and other measures, for transportation pipelines located in “high consequence areas,” which are those areas where a 46leak or rupture could do the most harm. The regulations require pipeline operators, including NGD and Enable, to, among other things:•perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;•develop a baseline plan to prioritize the assessment of a covered pipeline segment; •identify and characterize applicable threats that could impact a high consequence area; •improve data collection, integration, and analysis;•develop processes for performance management, record keeping, management of change and communication; •repair and remediate pipelines as necessary; and •implement preventive and mitigating action. Failure to comply with PHMSA or analogous state pipeline safety regulations could result in a number of consequences that may have an adverse effect on NGD’s and Enable’s operations. Both NGD and Enable incur significant costs associated with their compliance with existing PHMSA and comparable state regulations, which may not be recoverable in rates.Changes to pipeline safety laws and regulations that result in more stringent or costly safety standards could have a significant adverse effect on NGD and Enable. Changes to pipeline safety regulations occur frequently. For example, PHMSA published a final rule in October 2019 that extends and expands the reach of certain PHMSA integrity management requirements (e.g., period assessments, leak detection and repairs) regardless of proximity to a high consequence area. The adoption of new regulations requiring more comprehensive or stringent safety standards could require us to install new or modified safety controls, pursue new capital projects, or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, all of which could require us and Enable to incur increased and potentially significant operational costs.Aging infrastructure may lead to increased costs and disruptions in operations that could negatively impact our financial results.We have risks associated with aging infrastructure assets, including the failure of equipment or processes and potential breakdowns due to such aging. The age of certain of our assets may result in a need for replacement\\xa0or\\xa0higher level of maintenance costs because of our risk based federal and state compliant integrity management programs.\\xa0\\xa0Failure to achieve timely and full recovery of these expenses could\\xa0adversely impact revenues and could result in increased capital expenditures or expenses. In addition, the nature of information available on aging infrastructure assets may make inspections, maintenance, upgrading and replacement of the assets particularly challenging. Further, with respect to NGD’s operations, if certain pipeline replacements (for example, cast-iron or bare steel pipe) are not completed timely or successfully, government agencies and private parties might allege the uncompleted replacements caused events such as fires, explosions or leaks. Although we maintain insurance for certain of our facilities, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient in the event that a catastrophic loss is alleged to have been caused by a failure to timely complete equipment replacements. Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. \\xa0The operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees.Several of our businesses have entered into and have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions. We have several separate bargaining units, each with a unique collective bargaining agreement described below:\\xa0•The collective bargaining agreement with IBEW Local 66 related to employees of Houston Electric is scheduled to expire in May 2020, for which negotiations are anticipated to begin in March 2020;  •The collective bargaining agreements with USW Locals 13-227 and 13-1 related to NGD’s employees in Texas are scheduled to expire in June 2022 and July 2022, respectively; •The collective bargaining agreements with Gas Workers Union Local 340, IBEW Local 949 and OPEIU Local 12 and Mankato related to NGD employees in Minnesota are scheduled to expire in April 2020, December 2020, May 2021 and March 2021, respectively, and negotiations with Gas Workers Union Local 340 are currently in progress and expected to be completed before the April 2020 expiration; 47•The collective bargaining agreements with IBEW Local 1393, USW Locals 12213 and 7441 related to employees of NGD in Indiana are scheduled to expire in December 2020; •The collective bargaining agreements with the Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers Union Local 135 and Utility Workers Union Local 175 related to employees of Indiana Electric were recently renegotiated and are scheduled to expire in September 2021 and October 2021, respectively; and  •The collective bargaining agreement with IBEW Local 702 related to employees of Indiana Electric is scheduled to expire in June 2022.Additionally, Infrastructure Services negotiates various trade agreements through contractor associations.\\xa0\\xa0The two primary associations are the DCA and the PLCA.\\xa0\\xa0These trade agreements are with a variety of construction unions including Laborer’s International Union of North America, International Union of Operating Engineers, United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry, and Teamsters.\\xa0\\xa0The trade agreements have varying expiration dates in 2020, 2021 and 2022. In addition, these subsidiaries have various project agreements and small local agreements.\\xa0\\xa0These agreements expire upon completion of a specific project or on various dates throughout the year.Any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes, boycotts or other labor disruptions. These potential labor disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows. Labor disruptions, strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases, whether due to union activities, employee turnover or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows. Our businesses will continue to have to adapt to technological change and may not be successful or may have to incur significant expenditures to adapt to technological change. We operate in businesses that require sophisticated data collection, processing systems, software and other technology. Some of the technologies supporting the industries we serve are changing rapidly and increasing in complexity. New technologies will emerge or grow that may be superior to, or may not be compatible with, some of our existing technologies, and may require us to make significant investments and expenditures so that we can continue to provide cost-effective and reliable methods for energy production and delivery. Among such technological advances are distributed generation resources (e.g., private solar, microturbines, fuel cells), energy storage devices and more energy-efficient buildings and products designed to reduce energy consumption and waste. As these technologies become a more cost-competitive option over time, whether through cost effectiveness or government incentives and subsidies, certain customers may choose to meet their own energy needs and subsequently decrease usage of our systems and services, including Indiana Electric’s generating facilities becoming less competitive and economical. Further, certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates. Additionally, technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of energy efficiency in end-use electric and natural gas devices or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption.Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt to these technological changes in a cost-effective manner, to offer, on a timely basis, reliable services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards, and to recover all, or a significant portion of, any unrecovered investment in obsolete assets. If we fail to adapt successfully to any technological change or obsolescence, fail to obtain access to important technologies or incur significant expenditures in adapting to technological change, or if implemented technology does not operate as anticipated, our businesses, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.Our or Enable’s potential business strategies and strategic initiatives, including merger and acquisition activities and the disposition of assets or businesses, may not be completed or perform as expected.From time to time, we and Enable have made and may continue to make acquisitions or divestitures of businesses and assets, form joint ventures or undertake restructurings.  However, suitable acquisition candidates or potential buyers may not continue to be available on terms and conditions we or Enable, as the case may be, find acceptable, or the expected benefits of completed acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all, or may not be realized in the anticipated timeframe. If we or Enable are unable to make acquisitions or if those acquisitions do not perform as anticipated, our and Enable’s future growth may be adversely affected.On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020.  For 48further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements. We can make no assurances regarding the completion of this sale, which could be subject to delays or otherwise not consummated.Additionally, on February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. For further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements. We can make no assurances regarding the completion of this sale, which could be subject to delays or otherwise not consummated. As discussed in Note 16(d) to the consolidated financial statements, the existing CERC Corp. guarantees supporting CES’s obligations under natural gas supply, transportation and storage contracts will not terminate upon closing of the transaction.  While the buyer has an obligation to use its reasonable best efforts to cause CERC Corp. to be released from the guarantees as of and following closing, if the buyer is unable to do so, CERC Corp. would continue to have significant exposure under the guarantees. Following closing, if CES were to default on the payment obligations still guaranteed by CERC Corp., CERC Corp. could be obligated for such amounts. Further, any completed or future acquisitions involve substantial risks, including the following:•acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels;•acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate; •we or Enable may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us, that exceed our estimates, or for which our rights to indemnification from the seller are limited; •we or Enable may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems; and •acquisitions, or the pursuit of acquisitions, could disrupt our or Enable’s ongoing businesses, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain current business standards, controls and procedures.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We are involved in numerous legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are uncertain, and resolutions adverse to us could negatively affect our financial results.The Registrants are subject to numerous legal proceedings, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 16 to the Registrants’ respective consolidated financial statements. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and the Registrants cannot predict the outcome of all matters with assurance. Final resolution of these matters may require additional expenditures over an extended period of time that may be in excess of established insurance or reserves and may have a material adverse effect on the Registrants’ financial results. The Registrants could incur liabilities associated with businesses and assets that they have transferred to others.Under some circumstances, the Registrants could incur liabilities associated with assets and businesses no longer owned by them. These assets and businesses were previously owned by Reliant Energy, a predecessor of Houston Electric, directly or through subsidiaries and include:•merchant energy, energy trading and REP businesses transferred to RRI or its subsidiaries in connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI prior to its initial public offering in 2001 and now owned by affiliates of NRG; and•Texas electric generating facilities transferred to a subsidiary of Texas Genco in 2002, later sold to a third party and now owned by an affiliate of NRG.In connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI (now GenOn) and Texas Genco (now an affiliate of NRG), those companies and/or their subsidiaries assumed liabilities associated with various assets and businesses transferred to them and agreed to certain indemnity agreements of the Registrants. Such indemnities have applied in various asbestos and other environmental matters that arise from time to time and cases such as the litigation arising out of sales of natural gas in California and other markets, including in the gas market manipulation cases described in Note 16(e) to the Registrants’ respective consolidated financial statements. However, because of the settlement and discharge of certain of GenOn’s indemnity obligations in 2019 in 49its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, the Registrants will no longer have the benefit of any settled or discharged indemnities and could incur liabilities in matters that previously would have been\\xa0indemnified.In connection with our sale of Texas Genco, the separation agreement was amended to provide that Texas Genco would no longer be liable for, and CenterPoint Energy would assume and agree to indemnify Texas Genco against, liabilities that Texas Genco originally assumed in connection with its organization to the extent, and only to the extent, that such liabilities are covered by certain insurance policies held by CenterPoint Energy, and in certain of the asbestos lawsuits CenterPoint Energy has agreed to continue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered by insurance maintained by CenterPoint Energy, subject to reimbursement of the costs of such defense by an NRG affiliate.We are exposed to risks related to reduction in energy consumption due to factors such as unfavorable economic conditions in our service territories and changes in customers’ perceptions from recent incidents of other utilities involving natural gas pipelines.Our businesses are affected by reduction in energy consumption due to factors including economic climate in our service territories, energy efficiency initiatives, use of alternative technologies and changes in our customers’ perceptions regarding natural gas usage as a result of recent incidents of other utilities involving natural gas pipelines, which could impact our ability to grow our customer base and our rate of growth. Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and natural gas and the need for additional delivery facilities. Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside our control, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand-side management goals, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity.Declines in demand for natural gas in NGD’s territories due to recent pipeline incidents of other utilities and for electricity as a result of economic downturns in Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s regulated electric service territories will reduce overall sales and lessen cash flows, especially as industrial customers reduce production and, therefore, consumption of electricity. Although Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s transmission and distribution businesses are subject to regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of certain costs under periodic adjustment clauses, overall declines in electricity sold as a result of economic downturn or recession could reduce revenues and cash flows, thereby diminishing results of operations. Additionally, prolonged economic downturns that negatively impact results of operations and cash flows could result in future material impairment charges to write-down the carrying value of certain assets, including goodwill, to their respective fair values.For example, Houston Electric’s business is largely concentrated in Houston, Texas, where a higher percentage of employment is tied to the energy sector relative to other regions of the country. Although Houston, Texas has a diverse economy, employment in the energy industry remains important with overall Houston employment growing at a moderate rate in 2019 among various sectors. Further, the operations of Vectren’s utility businesses are concentrated in central and southern Indiana and west-central Ohio and are therefore impacted by changes in the Midwest economy in general and changes in particular industries concentrated in the Midwest.\\xa0\\xa0These industries include automotive assembly, parts and accessories; feed, flour and grain processing; metal castings, plastic products; gypsum products; electrical equipment, metal specialties, glass and steel finishing; pharmaceutical and nutritional products; gasoline and oil products; ethanol; and coal mining. In the event economic conditions further decline, the respective rates of growth in Houston, Indiana and the other areas in which we operate may also deteriorate. Changing market conditions, including changing regulation, changes in market prices of oil or other commodities, or changes in government regulation and assistance, may cause certain industrial customers to reduce or cease production and thereby decrease consumption of natural gas and/or electricity. Increases in customer defaults or delays in payment due to liquidity constraints could negatively impact our cash flows and financial condition. Some or all of these factors, could result in a lack of growth or decline in customer demand for electricity or number of customers, and may result in our failure to fully realize anticipated benefits from significant capital investments and expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on their financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Our businesses may be adversely affected by the intentional misconduct of our employees.We are committed to living our core values of safety, integrity, accountability, initiative and respect and complying with all applicable laws and regulations. Despite that commitment and our efforts to prevent misconduct, it is possible for employees to engage in intentional misconduct, fail to uphold our core values, and violate laws and regulations for individual gain through contract or procurement fraud, misappropriation, bribery or corruption, fraudulent related-party transactions and serious breaches of our Ethics and Compliance Code and Standards of Conduct/Business Ethics policy, among other policies. If such intentional misconduct by employees should occur, it could result in substantial liability, higher costs, increased regulatory scrutiny and 50negative public perceptions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Item 1B.Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 2.PropertiesThe following discussion is based on the Registrants’ businesses and equity method investment as of December 31, 2019.Character of OwnershipWe lease or own our principal properties in fee, including our corporate office space and various real property.

Our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about, or interpretations of, available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results. Factors Influencing Our Businesses and Industry TrendsWe are an energy delivery company. The majority of our revenues are generated from the transmission and delivery of electricity and the sale of natural gas by our subsidiaries. On February 1, 2019, we acquired Vectren for approximately $6 billion in cash. Through its subsidiaries, Vectren’s operations consist of utility and non-utility businesses. The utility operations include three public utilities, Indiana Gas, SIGECO and VEDO, which, in the aggregate, provide natural gas distribution and transportation services to nearly 67% of Indiana and about 20% of Ohio and electric transmission and distribution services to southwestern Indiana, including power generating and wholesale power operations.\\xa0In total, these utility operations supply natural gas and electricity to over one million customers in Indiana and Ohio. The non-utility operations include Infrastructure Services and ESG. Infrastructure Services, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, provides underground pipeline and repair services to many utilities, including our utilities, as well as other industries.\\xa0ESG provides energy services through performance-based energy contracting operations and sustainable infrastructure services, such as renewables, distributed generation and combined heat and power projects.\\xa0ESG assists schools, hospitals, governmental facilities and other private institutions with reducing energy and maintenance costs by upgrading their facilities with energy-efficient equipment.\\xa0ESG operates throughout the United States. Concurrent with the completion of the Merger, we added two new reportable segments, Indiana Electric Integrated and Infrastructure Services. On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. For further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements.To assess our financial performance, our management primarily monitors operating income and cash flows, among other things, from our reportable segments. Within these broader financial measures, we monitor margins, interest expense, capital spending and working capital requirements. In addition to these financial measures, we also monitor a number of variables that management considers important to our reportable segments, including the number of customers, throughput, use per customer, commodity prices and heating and cooling degree days. From an operational standpoint, we monitor operation and maintenance expense, safety factors, system reliability and customer satisfaction to gauge our performance.The nature of our businesses requires significant amounts of capital investment, and we rely on internally generated cash, borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from commercial paper and issuances of debt and equity in the capital markets to satisfy these capital needs. We strive to maintain investment grade ratings for our securities to access the capital markets on terms we consider reasonable. A reduction in our ratings generally would increase our borrowing costs for new issuances of debt, as well as borrowing costs under our existing revolving credit facilities, and may prevent us from accessing the commercial paper markets. Disruptions in the financial markets can also affect the availability of new capital on terms we consider attractive. In those circumstances, we may not be able to obtain certain types of external financing or may be required to accept terms less favorable than they would otherwise accept. For that reason, we seek to maintain adequate liquidity for our businesses through existing credit facilities and prudent refinancing of existing debt. \\xa0To the extent adverse economic conditions affect our suppliers and customers, results from our energy delivery businesses may suffer.\\xa0For example, Houston Electric is largely concentrated in Houston, Texas, where a higher percentage of employment is tied to the energy sector relative to other regions of the country.  Despite Houston, Texas having a diverse economy, employment 55in the energy industry remains important with overall Houston employment growing at a moderate rate in 2019 among various sectors. Although the Houston area represents a large part of our customer base, we have a diverse customer base throughout the eight states we serve.\\xa0 Each state has a unique economy and is driven by different industrial sectors.\\xa0Our largest customers reflect the diversity in industries in the states across our footprint.\\xa0 In Minnesota, for instance, education and health services are  the state’s largest sectors, whereas Arkansas has a large food manufacturing industry. Some industries are driven by population growth like education and health care, while others may be influenced by strength in the national or international economy. Further, the operations of Vectren’s utility businesses are concentrated in central and southern Indiana and west-central Ohio and are therefore impacted by changes in the Midwest economy in general and changes in particular industries concentrated in the Midwest.\\xa0\\xa0These industries include automotive assembly, parts and accessories; feed, flour and grain processing; metal castings; plastic products; gypsum products; electrical equipment; metal specialties; glass and steel finishing; pharmaceutical and nutritional products; gasoline and oil products; ethanol; and coal mining.Also, adverse economic conditions, coupled with concerns for protecting the environment and increased availability of alternate energy sources, may cause consumers to use less energy or avoid expansions of their facilities, including natural gas facilities, resulting in less demand for our services. Long-term national trends indicate customers have reduced their energy consumption, which could adversely affect our results. However, due to more affordable energy prices and continued economic improvement in the areas we serve, the trend toward lower usage has slowed.To the extent population growth is affected by lower energy prices and there is financial pressure on some of our customers who operate within the energy industry, there may be an impact on the growth rate of our customer base and overall demand. Multifamily residential customer growth is affected by the cyclical nature of apartment construction. Beginning in 2019, a new construction cycle in Houston helped overall residential customer growth to return to the long-term trend of 2%. Management expects residential meter growth for Houston Electric to remain in line with long term trends at approximately 2%. Typical customer growth in the jurisdictions served by the Natural Gas Distribution reportable segment is approximately 1%. CERC’s NGD customer growth was 1.3% for 2019, which is slightly higher than in previous years. Performance of the Houston Electric T&D reportable segment and the Natural Gas Distribution reportable segment is significantly influenced by energy usage per customer, which is significantly impacted by weather conditions. For Houston Electric, revenues are generally higher during the warmer months when more electricity is used for cooling purposes. For CERC’s NGD, demand for natural gas for heating purposes is generally higher in the colder months. Therefore, we compare our results on a weather-adjusted basis.\\xa0In 2019, the Houston area experienced weather that was closer to normal compared to 2018. Although the summer months, particularly August and September, were hotter than normal, this was offset during the remaining months of the year due to milder than normal weather. While overall rainfall was higher than normal in 2019 largely due to Tropical Storm Imelda, it did not rise to the record rainfall levels experienced in 2017 that occurred largely due to Hurricane Harvey. After a return to more normal weather in 2018, our NGD service territories experienced warmer weather in 2019 in all areas except Minnesota.Historically, both CenterPoint Energy’s TDU and CERC’s NGD have utilized weather hedges to help reduce the impact of mild weather on their financial results.\\xa0CenterPoint Energy’s TDU and CERC’s NGD entered into a weather hedge for the  2018–2019 and 2019–2020 winter heating seasons in Texas where no weather normalization mechanisms exist. In CERC’s non-Texas jurisdictions, weather normalization mechanisms or decoupling in the Minnesota division help to mitigate the impact of abnormal weather on our financial results.\\xa0In Minnesota and Arkansas for CERC’s NGD, there are rate adjustment mechanisms to counter the impact of declining usage from energy efficiency improvements. In addition, in many of our service areas, particularly in the Houston area and Minnesota, as applicable to each registrant, we have benefited from growth in the number of customers, which could mitigate the effects of reduced consumption.\\xa0We anticipate that this trend will continue as the regions’ economies continue to grow.\\xa0The profitability of our businesses is influenced significantly by the regulatory treatment we receive from the various state and local regulators who set our electric and natural gas distribution rates.Sales of natural gas and electricity to residential and commercial customers by Indiana Gas, SIGECO and VEDO are largely seasonal and are impacted by weather.\\xa0Trends in the average consumption among natural gas residential and commercial customers have tended to decline as more efficient appliances and furnaces are installed, and as these utilities have implemented conservation programs.\\xa0In our NGD Indiana and Ohio service territories, normal temperature adjustment and decoupling mechanisms largely mitigate the effect that would otherwise be caused by variations in volumes sold to these customers due to weather and changing consumption patterns.\\xa0Our NGD operations in Ohio has a straight fixed variable rate design for its residential customers.\\xa0This rate design mitigates approximately 90% of the Ohio service territory’s weather risk and risk of decreasing consumption specific to its small 56customer classes. While Indiana Electric has neither a normal temperature adjustment mechanism nor a decoupling mechanism, rate designs provide for a lost margin recovery mechanism that operates in tandem with conservation initiatives.On April 5, 2019, and subsequently adjusted in errata filings in May and June 2019, Houston Electric filed its base rate application with the PUCT and the cities in its service area to change its rates. A settlement has been reached and a final order from the PUCT is expected during the first quarter of 2020. For details related to our pending and completed regulatory proceedings and orders related to the TCJA in 2019 and to date in 2020, see “—Liquidity and Capital Resources —Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference.We believe the long-term outlook for ESG’s performance contracting and sustainable infrastructure opportunities remains strong with continued national focus expected on energy conservation and sustainability, renewable energy and security as power prices across the country rise and customer focus on new, efficient and clean sources of energy grows.The regulation of natural gas pipelines and related facilities by federal and state regulatory agencies affects CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s businesses. In accordance with natural gas pipeline safety and integrity regulations, CenterPoint Energy and CERC are making, and will continue to make, significant capital investments in their service territories, which are necessary to help operate and maintain a safe, reliable and growing natural gas system. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s compliance expenses may also increase as a result of preventative measures required under these regulations. Consequently, new rates in the areas they serve are necessary to recover these increasing costs.Consistent with the regulatory treatment of pension costs, the Registrants defer the amount of pension expense that differs from the level of pension expense included in the Registrants’ base rates for the Electric T&D reportable segment and Natural Gas Distribution reportable segment in their Texas jurisdictions. CenterPoint Energy expects to contribute a minimum of approximately $83 million to its pension plans in 2020. Factors Influencing Our Businesses Proposed for DivestitureThe Energy Services reportable segment contracts with customers for transportation, storage and sales of natural gas on an unregulated basis.\\xa0Its operations serve customers throughout the United States.\\xa0The segment is impacted by price differentials on both a regional and seasonal basis, as well as fluctuations in regional daily natural gas prices driven by weather and other market factors. While this business utilizes financial derivatives to mitigate the effects of price movements, it does not enter into risk management contracts for speculative purposes and evaluates VaR daily to monitor significant financial exposures to realized income.\\xa0Energy Services experienced instances of decreased margin in 2019 due to fewer opportunities to optimize natural gas supply costs as compared to 2018. Specifically, weather-facilitated market impacts in various regions of the continental United States during the three months ended March 31, 2018 allowed Energy Services to increase its margins in the first quarter of 2018. On February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. For further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements.Demand for Infrastructure Services remains high due to the aging infrastructure and evolving safety and reliability regulations across the United States. The long-term focus for Infrastructure Services is recurring work in both the distribution and transmission businesses. The timing and recurrence of large transmission projects is less predictable and may create volatility in its year-over-year results.  On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. For further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements.Factors Influencing Midstream Investments (CenterPoint Energy)The results of CenterPoint Energy’s Midstream Investments reportable segment are dependent upon the results of Enable, which are driven primarily by the volume of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil that Enable gathers, processes and transports across its systems. These volumes depend significantly on the level of production from natural gas wells connected to Enable’s systems across a number of U.S. mid-continent markets. Aggregate production volumes are affected by the overall amount of oil and gas drilling and completion activities. Production must be maintained or increased by new drilling or other activity, because the production rate of oil and gas wells declines over time.Enable expects its business to continue to be impacted by the trends affecting the midstream industry. Enable’s outlook is based on its management’s assumptions regarding the impact of these trends that it has developed by interpreting the information currently available to it. If Enable management’s assumptions or interpretation of available information prove to be incorrect, Enable’s future financial condition and results of operations may differ materially from its expectations.57Enable’s business is impacted by commodity prices, which have declined and otherwise experienced significant volatility in recent years. Commodity prices impact the drilling and production of natural gas and crude oil in the areas served by Enable’s systems. In addition, Enable’s processing arrangements expose it to commodity price fluctuations. Enable has attempted to mitigate the impact of commodity prices on its business by entering into hedges, focusing on contracting fee-based business and converting existing commodity-based contracts to fee-based contracts. Enable’s long-term view is that natural gas and crude oil production in the U.S. will increase. Advancements in technology have allowed producers to efficiently extract natural gas and crude oil from tight gas formations and shale plays. As a result, the proven reserves of natural gas and crude oil in the United States have significantly increased. As proven reserves of natural gas and crude oil have continued to increase, the supply growth has outpaced demand growth, resulting in oversupply. The oversupply of natural gas and crude oil has resulted in price declines over the last year. Natural gas continues to be a critical component of energy demand in the U.S. Enable’s management believes that, although oversupply will continue in the near term, the prospects for continued natural gas demand are favorable over the long term and will be driven by population and economic growth, the continued displacement of coal-fired power plants by natural gas-fired power plants due to the price of natural gas and stricter government environmental regulations on the mining and burning of coal and the continued development of a global export market for LNG. Enable’s management believes that increasing consumption of natural gas over the long term, both within the United States and in the global export market for LNG, will continue to drive demand for Enable’s natural gas gathering, processing, transportation and storage services.Significant EventsProposed Divestiture of Infrastructure Services.  On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020.  For further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements.Proposed Divestiture of CES.  On February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020.  For further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements.Regulatory Proceedings.\\xa0On April 5, 2019, and subsequently adjusted in errata filings in May and June 2019, Houston Electric filed its base rate application with the PUCT and the cities in its service area to change its rates. A settlement has been reached  and a final order from the PUCT in the proceeding is expected during the first quarter of 2020.

For more information about the 2019 debt transactions, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.CERTAIN FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE EARNINGS Our past earnings and results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our future earnings and results of operations. The magnitude of our and Enable’s future earnings and results of our and Enable’s operations will depend on or be affected by numerous factors that apply to all Registrants unless otherwise indicated including:•the performance of Enable, the amount of cash distributions CenterPoint Energy receives from Enable, Enable’s ability to redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units in certain circumstances and the value of CenterPoint Energy’s interest in Enable, and factors that may have a material impact on such performance, cash distributions and value, including factors such as:◦competitive

available to common shareholders of $674 million ($1.33\\xa0per diluted common share) for 2019 compared to $333 million ($0.74\\xa0per diluted common share) for 2018. The increase in income available to common shareholders of $341 million was primarily due to the following key factors:•a  $395 million increase in operating income, discussed below by reportable segment in Results of Operations by Reportable Segment;•a $304 million increase in gain on marketable securities, included in Other Income (Expense), net shown above;•a $20 million decrease in interest expense related to lower outstanding balances of the Securitization Bonds; and•an $8 million decrease in income tax expense primarily due to the lower effective tax rate, as explained below, partially offset by higher income before income taxes.These increases were partially offset by:•a $167 million increase in interest expense, primarily as a result of higher outstanding long-term debt used to finance the Merger and additional long-term debt acquired in the Merger, discussed further in Notes 4 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements;•an $82 million increase in preferred stock dividend requirements primarily as a result of the Merger;61•a $77 million decrease to equity in earnings from the investment in Enable, which includes CenterPoint Energy’s share  ($46 million) of Enable’s goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019 discussed further in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements; and•a $60 million increase in losses on the underlying value of the indexed debt securities related to the ZENS included in Other Income (Expense), net shown above.Income Tax Expense. CenterPoint Energy reported an effective tax rate of 15% and 28% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The lower effective tax rate of 15% is due to an increase in the amount of amortization of the net regulatory EDIT liability as decreed by regulators in certain jurisdictions, the effect of state law changes that resulted in the remeasurement of state deferred taxes, and the impact of the reduction in valuation allowances on certain state net operating losses that are now expected to be realized.2018 Compared to 2017 Net Income.\\xa0\\xa0CenterPoint Energy reported income available to common shareholders of $333 million ($0.74\\xa0per diluted common share) for 2018 compared to $1,792 million ($4.13\\xa0per diluted common share) for 2017. The decrease in income available to common shareholders of $1,459 million was primarily due to the following key factors:•an $875 million increase in income tax expense, resulting from a reduction in income tax expense of $1,113 million due to tax reform in 2017, discussed further in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, offset by a $238 million decrease in income tax expense primarily due to a reduction in the corporate income tax rate resulting from the TCJA in 2018 and lower income before income taxes year over year;•a $305 million decrease in operating income, discussed below by reportable segment in Results of Operations by Reportable Segment;•a $281 million increase in losses on indexed debt securities related to the ZENS, resulting from a loss of $11 million from Meredith’s acquisition of Time in March 2018, a loss of $242 million from AT&T’s acquisition of TW in June 2018 and reduced gains of $28 million in the underlying value of the indexed debt securities;•a $48 million increase in interest expense primarily due to higher outstanding other long-term debt and the amortization of Bridge Facility fees of $24 million;•a $35 million increase in preferred stock dividend requirements; and•a $29 million increase in losses on marketable securities.These decreases were partially offset by:•a $42 million increase in equity earnings from the investment in Enable, discussed further in\\xa0Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements;•a $25 million increase in interest income on investments included in Other Income (Expense), net shown above;•a $17 million decrease in the non-service cost components of net periodic pension and post-retirement costs included in Other Income (Expense), net shown above;•an $18 million decrease in interest expense related to lower outstanding balances of the Securitization Bonds;•a $6 million increase in miscellaneous other non-operating income included in Other Income (Expense), net shown above;•a $4 million increase in dividend income on CenterPoint Energy’s ZENS-Related Securities included in Other Income (Expense), net shown above; and•a $2 million increase in gains on interest rate economic hedges included in Other Income (Expense), net shown above.62Income Tax Expense. CenterPoint Energy reported an effective tax rate of 28% and (69)% for the years ended December\\xa031, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The effective tax rate of 28% is primarily due to the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 as prescribed by the TCJA and the amortization of EDIT. These decreases were partially offset by an increase to the effective tax rate as a result of the establishment of a valuation allowance on certain state net operating loss deferred tax assets that are no longer expected to be utilized prior to expiration after the Internal Spin. The effective tax rate was also increased for state law changes that resulted in remeasurement of state deferred taxes in those jurisdictions. HOUSTON ELECTRIC CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSHouston Electric’s results of operations are affected by seasonal fluctuations in the demand for electricity. Houston Electric’s results of operations are also affected by, among other things, the actions of various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over rates Houston Electric charges, debt service costs, income tax expense, Houston Electric’s ability to collect receivables from REPs and Houston Electric’s ability to recover its regulatory assets. \\xa0Year Ended December\\xa031,\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017\\xa0(in millions)Revenues$2,990\\xa0$3,234\\xa0$2,998Expenses2,372\\xa02,609\\xa02,361Operating Income618\\xa0625\\xa0637Interest and other finance charges(164)\\xa0(138)\\xa0(128)Interest on Securitization Bonds(39)\\xa0(59)\\xa0(77)Other income (expense), net21\\xa0(3)\\xa0(8)Income before income taxes436\\xa0425\\xa0424Income tax expense (benefit)80\\xa089\\xa0(9)Net income$356\\xa0$336\\xa0$4332019 Compared to 2018 Net Income.\\xa0\\xa0Houston Electric reported net income of $356 million for 2019 compared to $336 million for 2018.The increase of $20 million in net income was primarily due to the following key factors:•a $24 million increase in Other income (expense), net primarily due to increased interest income of $22 million mainly from investments in the CenterPoint Energy money pool;•a $14 million increase in TDU operating income discussed below in Results of Operations by Reportable Segment, exclusive of an $8 million gain from weather hedges recorded at CenterPoint Energy; and•a $9 million decrease in income tax expense primarily due to the lower effective tax rate, as explained below,  partially offset by higher income before income taxes.These increases to net income were partially offset by a $26 million increase in interest expense due to higher outstanding other long-term debt.Income Tax Expense.\\xa0 Houston Electric reported an effective tax rate of 18% and 21% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for a more in-depth discussion of the 2018 impacts of the TCJA. CERC CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSCERC’s results of operations are affected by seasonal fluctuations in the demand for natural gas and price movements of energy commodities as well as natural gas basis differentials. CERC’s results of operations are also affected by, among other things, the actions of various federal, state and local governmental authorities having jurisdiction over rates CERC charges, competition in CERC’s various business operations, the effectiveness of CERC’s risk management activities, debt service costs and income tax expense. \\xa0Year Ended December\\xa031,\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017\\xa0(in millions)Revenues$6,570\\xa0$7,343\\xa0$6,603Expenses6,220\\xa07,121\\xa06,136Operating Income 350\\xa0222\\xa0467Interest and other finance charges(116)\\xa0(122)\\xa0(123)Other expense, net(8)\\xa0(8)\\xa0(25)Income from continuing operations before income taxes226\\xa092\\xa0319Income tax expense (benefit)14\\xa022\\xa0(265)Income from continuing operations212\\xa070\\xa0584Income from discontinued operations, net of tax—\\xa0138\\xa0161Net Income$212\\xa0$208\\xa0$7452019 Compared to 2018 Net Income.\\xa0\\xa0CERC reported net income of $212 million for 2019 compared to $208 million for 2018.The increase in net income of $4 million was primarily due to the following key factors:•a $128 million increase in operating income discussed below in Results of Operations by Reportable Segment; •an $8 million decrease in income tax expense due to the lower effective tax rate, as explained below, partially offset by higher income from continuing operations ; and•a $6 million decrease in interest and other finance charges.64These increases were partially offset by a $138 million decrease in income from discontinued operations, net of tax, discussed further in Notes 11 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements.Income Tax Expense.  CERC’s effective tax rate reported on income from continuing operations was 6% and 24% for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  The lower effective tax rate of 6% on income from continuing operations is due to an increase in the amount of amortization of the net regulatory EDIT liability as decreed by regulators in certain jurisdictions, the effect of state law changes that resulted in the remeasurement of state deferred taxes, and the impact of the reduction in valuation allowances on certain state net operating losses that are now expected to be realized.2018 Compared to 2017 Net Income.\\xa0\\xa0CERC reported net income of $208 million for 2018 compared to net income of $745 million for 2017.The decrease in net income of $537 million was primarily due to the following key factors:•a $287 million increase in income tax expense, resulting from a reduction in income tax expense of $396 million due to tax reform in 2017, discussed further in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, offset by a $109 million decrease in income tax expense primarily due to lower income from continuing operations and a reduction in the corporate income tax rate resulting from the TCJA in 2018; •a $245 million decrease in operating income, discussed below by reportable segment in Results of Operations by Reportable Segment; and•a $23 million decrease in income from discontinued operations, net of tax, due to the Internal Spin discussed further in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.These decreases were partially offset by:•a $12 million decrease in the non-service cost components of net periodic pension and post-retirement costs included in Other expense, net shown above;•a $5 million increase in miscellaneous other non-operating income included in Other expense, net shown above; and•a $1 million decrease in interest expense due to lower outstanding long-term debt.Income Tax Expense.

Weather hedge gains (losses) of $6 million, $(2) million and $(1) million were recorded at CenterPoint Energy’s Houston Electric T&D reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See Note 9(a) to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the weather hedge.(2)Operating income from the Bond Companies, together with $5 million, $4 million and $2 million of interest income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, are necessary to pay interest on the Securitization Bonds.2019 Compared to 2018.\\xa0\\xa0The Houston Electric T&D reportable segment reported operating income of $624\\xa0million for 2019, consisting of $590 million\\xa0from the TDU and $34 million related to the Bond Companies. For 2018, operating income totaled $623\\xa0million, consisting of $568 million from the TDU and $55 million related to the Bond Companies.  TDU operating income increased $22 million primarily due to the following key factors:•higher transmission-related revenues of $74 million, exclusive of the TCJA impact mentioned below, partially offset by higher transmission costs billed by transmission providers of $57 million; •decreased operation and maintenance expenses of $34 million, net of $10 million of Merger-related severance costs and $12 million of write offs for rate case expenses associated with the settlement of Houston Electric’s rate case, primarily due to lower labor and benefits costs and lower support services costs; •customer growth of $28 million from the addition of over 48,000 customers; 67•rate increases of $20 million related to distribution capital investments, exclusive of the TCJA impact mentioned below; and•higher miscellaneous revenues of $14 million primarily related to right-of-way revenues.The increase in operating income was partially offset by the following:•lower equity return of $29 million, primarily related to the annual true-up of transition charges to correct over-collections that occurred during the preceding 12 months and due to the winding up of Transition Bond Company II; •higher depreciation and amortization expense, primarily because of ongoing additions to plant in service, and other taxes of $26 million; •lower usage of $20 million due to lower residential use per customer and lower demand in our large commercial and small industrial classes in part due to less favorable weather in early 2019; and•lower revenue of $15 million related to the impact of the TCJA.Lower depreciation and amortization expenses related to AMS of $28 million were offset by a corresponding decrease in related revenues.2018 Compared to 2017.\\xa0\\xa0The Houston Electric T&D reportable segment reported operating income of $623\\xa0million for 2018, consisting of $568 million\\xa0from the TDU and $55 million related to the Bond Companies. For 2017, operating income totaled $636 million, consisting of $561 million from the TDU and $75 million related to the Bond Companies.  TDU operating income increased $7 million primarily due to the following key factors:•higher transmission-related revenues of $37 million, exclusive of the TCJA impact, and lower transmission costs billed by transmission providers of $32 million;•customer growth of $31 million from the addition of over 41,000 customers;•rate increases of $36 million related to distribution capital investments, exclusive of the TCJA; •higher equity return of $32 million, primarily related to the annual true-up of transition charges correcting for under-collections that occurred during the preceding 12 months;•higher miscellaneous revenues of $9 million largely due to right-of-way and fiber and wireless revenues; and•higher usage of $8 million, primarily due to a return to more normal weather.The increase to operating income was partially offset by the following:•increased operation and maintenance expenses of\\xa0$79 million, excluding transmission costs billed by transmission providers,\\xa0primarily due to the following:◦contract services of $24 million, largely due to increased resiliency spend and services related to fiber and wireless;◦support services of $23 million, primarily related to technology projects;◦labor and benefits costs of $14 million; ◦other miscellaneous operation and maintenance expenses of $12 million; and◦damage claims from third parties of\\xa0$6 million;•lower revenues of $79 million due to the recording of a regulatory liability and a corresponding decrease to revenue of $31 million reflecting the difference in revenues collected under customer rates at the pre-TCJA tax rate and the revenues 68that would have been collected had rates been adjusted to the lower corporate tax rate upon TCJA enactment and lower revenues of $48 million due to lower transmission and distribution rate filings as a result of the TCJA; and•higher depreciation and amortization expense, primarily because of ongoing additions to plant in service, and other taxes of $17 million.Lower depreciation and amortization expenses related to AMS of $21 million were offset by a corresponding decrease in related revenues.Indiana Electric Integrated (CenterPoint Energy)The following table provides summary data of CenterPoint Energy’s Indiana Electric Integrated reportable segment:\\xa0\\xa0Year Ended\\xa0December 31, 2019 (1)\\xa0\\xa0(in millions, except throughput and customer data)Revenues\\xa0$523Expenses:\\xa0\\xa0Utility natural gas, fuel and purchased power\\xa0149Operation and maintenance\\xa0179Depreciation and amortization\\xa091Taxes other than income taxes\\xa014Total expenses\\xa0433Operating Income\\xa0$90Throughput (in GWh):\\xa0\\xa0Retail\\xa04,310Wholesale\\xa0376Total\\xa04,686Number of metered customers at end of period:\\xa0\\xa0Residential\\xa0128,947Total\\xa0147,942(1)Represents February 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019 results only due to the Merger.2019 Compared to 2018.

The Energy Services reportable segment reported operating income of $32 million for 2019 compared to an operating loss of $47 million for 2018.  Operating income increased $79 million as a result of the following:• a $149 million increase from mark-to-market accounting for derivatives associated with certain natural gas purchases and sales used to lock in economic margins. The increase in operating income was partially offset by the following:•a $48 million goodwill impairment charge. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information; and•a $22 million decrease in margin due to fewer opportunities to optimize natural gas costs relative to 2018, primarily in the first quarter of 2019. Weather-driven market impacts in various regions of the continental United States provided increased margins during  the first quarter of 2018 which were not repeated in 2019.On February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. For further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements.2018 Compared to 2017. The Energy Services reportable segment reported an operating loss of $47 million for 2018 compared to operating income of $126 million for 2017. 74Operating income decreased $173 million as a result of the following key factors:•a $189 million decrease from mark-to-market accounting for derivatives associated with certain natural gas purchases and sales used to lock in economic margins; and•a $10 million increase in operation and maintenance expenses, attributable to increased technology expenses, higher contract and services expense related to pipeline integrity testing, higher support services and legal expenses. The decrease in operating income was partially offset by the following:•a $22 million increase in margin due to increased opportunities to optimize natural gas supply costs through storage and transportation capacity, primarily in the first quarter of 2018, and incremental volumes from customers. Realized commercial opportunities attributable to the Continuum and AEM acquisitions and colder than normal weather in several regions of the United States, primarily in the first quarter of 2018, drove incremental sales volumes; and•a $5 million increase in margin due to increased revenues from energy delivery to customers through CEIP interconnect projects and MES’ portable natural gas supply services.Infrastructure Services (CenterPoint Energy)\\xa0The following table provides summary data of the Infrastructure Services reportable segment: \\xa0\\xa0Year Ended\\xa0December 31, 2019 (1)\\xa0\\xa0(in millions, except throughput and customer data)Revenues\\xa0$1,190Expenses:\\xa0\\xa0Non-utility cost of revenues, including natural gas\\xa0309Operation and maintenance\\xa0734Depreciation and amortization\\xa050Taxes other than income taxes\\xa02Total expenses\\xa01,095Operating Income\\xa0$95Backlog at period end (2): \\xa0\\xa0Blanket contracts (3)\\xa0$628Bid contracts (4)\\xa0254Total \\xa0$882(1)Represents February 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019 results only due to the Merger.(2)Backlog represents the amount of revenue Infrastructure Services expects to realize from work to be performed on uncompleted contracts in the next twelve months, including new contractual agreements on which work has not begun. Infrastructure Services operates primarily under two types of contracts, blanket contracts and bid contracts. (3)Under blanket contracts, customers are not contractually committed to specific volumes of services; however, Infrastructure Services expects to be chosen to perform work needed by a customer in a given time frame. These contracts are typically awarded on an annual or multi-year basis. For blanket work, backlog represents an estimate of the amount of revenue that Infrastructure Services expects to realize from work to be performed in the next twelve months on existing contracts or contracts management expects to be renewed or awarded. (4)Using bid contracts, customers are contractually committed to a specific service to be performed for a specific price, whether in total for a project or on a per unit basis.2019 Compared to 2018.  The Infrastructure Services reportable segment reported operating income of  $95\\xa0million for 2019, which includes $13 million for Merger-related severance and incentive compensation costs, $19 million of Merger-related 75amortization of intangibles for construction backlog recorded in Non-utility cost of revenues, including natural gas, and $11 million of Merger-related intangibles amortization recorded in depreciation and amortization. These results are not comparable to 2018 as this reportable segment was acquired in the Merger as discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reportable segment.

Capital expenditures are expected to be used for investment in infrastructure for electric and natural gas distribution operations.\\xa0These capital expenditures are anticipated to maintain reliability and safety, increase resiliency and expand our systems through value-added projects.  In addition to dividend payments on CenterPoint Energy’s Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Common Stock, and in addition to interest payments on debt, the Registrants’ principal anticipated cash requirements for 2020 include the following:\\xa0\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0\\xa0(in millions)Estimated capital expenditures\\xa0$2,630\\xa0$1,031\\xa0$702Scheduled principal payments on Securitization Bonds\\xa0231\\xa0231\\xa0—Minimum contributions to pension plans and other post-retirement plans\\xa0100\\xa09\\xa03Maturing Vectren term loans\\xa0600\\xa0—\\xa0—The Registrants expect that anticipated 2020 cash needs will be met with borrowings under their credit facilities, proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, term loans or common stock, anticipated cash flows from operations, with respect to CenterPoint Energy and CERC, proceeds from commercial paper and with respect to CenterPoint Energy, distributions from Enable.  Additionally, proceeds from the expected closing of the transactions underlying the Securities Purchase Agreement and Equity Purchase Agreement will be used to repay outstanding debt. Discretionary financing or refinancing may result in the issuance of equity securities of CenterPoint Energy or debt securities of the Registrants in the capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities or term bank loans. Issuances of equity or debt in the capital markets, funds raised in the commercial paper markets and additional credit facilities may not, however, be available on acceptable terms.

This rate filing is based on a rate base of $6.4 billion, a 50% debt/50% equity capital structure and a 10.4% ROE. Houston Electric last filed for a base rate increase on June 30, 2010, with a test year ending December 31, 2009. Houston Electric also requested a prudency determination on all capital investments made since January 1, 2010, the establishment of a rider to refund over three years to its customers approximately $119 million of unprotected EDIT resulting from the TCJA, updated depreciation rates and approval to clarify and update various non-rate tariff provisions. Recovery of all reasonable and necessary rate case expenses for this case and certain prior rate case proceedings were severed into a separate proceeding. A hearing was held June 24–28, 2019. On September 16, 2019, the ALJs issued a PFD. The PUCT began deliberating on the PFD (which is prepared by ALJs at a different state agency) during its November 14, 2019 open meeting but delayed final determination for further consideration.  The PUCT again discussed the Houston Electric rate case at its December 13, 2019 open meeting and concluded that the PUCT would consider settlement a reasonable approach to resolving the rate case and noted that Houston Electric had indicated settlement negotiations were already underway. Houston Electric updated the PUCT at its January 16, 2020 open meeting regarding the status of settlement discussions, indicating that the parties were working on a settlement and anticipated a final settlement in the near future. On January 23, 2020, Houston Electric filed a Stipulation and Settlement Agreement with the PUCT that provides for the following, among other things: •an overall revenue requirement increase of approximately $13 million; •an ROE of 9.4%; •a capital structure of 57.5% debt/42.5% equity; •a refund of unprotected EDIT of $105 million plus carrying costs over approximately 30-36 months; and•recovery of all retail transmission related costs through the TCRF. Also, Houston Electric is not required to make a one-time refund of capital recovery from its TCOS and DCRF mechanisms. Future TCOS filings will take into account both ADFIT and EDIT until the final order from Houston Electric’s next base rate proceeding. No rate base items are required to be written off; however, approximately $12 million in rate case expenses were written off in 2019. A base rate application must be filed for Houston Electric no later than four years from the date of the PUCT’s final order in the proceeding. Additionally, Houston Electric will not file a DCRF in 2020, nor will a subsequent separate proceeding with the PUCT be instituted regarding EDIT on Houston Electric’s securitized assets.   Furthermore, under the terms of the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement, Houston Electric agreed to adopt certain ring-fencing measures to increase its financial separateness from CenterPoint Energy, which include the following:  •Houston Electric’s credit agreements and indentures shall not contain cross-default provisions by which a default by CenterPoint Energy or its other affiliates would cause a default at Houston Electric;81•The financial covenant in Houston Electric’s credit agreement shall not be related to any entity other than Houston Electric.  Houston Electric shall not include in its debt or credit agreements any financial covenants or rating agency triggers related to any entity other than Houston Electric; •Houston Electric shall not pledge its assets in respect of or guarantee any debt or obligation of any of its affiliates. Houston Electric shall not pledge, mortgage, hypothecate, or grant a lien upon the property of Houston Electric except pursuant to an exception in effect in Houston Electric’s current credit agreement, such as Houston Electric’s first mortgage and general mortgage; •Houston Electric shall maintain its own stand-alone credit facility, and Houston Electric shall not share its credit facility with any regulated or unregulated affiliate; •Houston Electric shall maintain ratings with all three major credit ratings agencies; •Houston Electric shall maintain a stand-alone credit rating; •Houston Electric’s first mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds shall be secured only with assets of Houston Electric;\\xa0•No Houston Electric assets may be used to secure the debt of CenterPoint Energy or its other affiliates; •Houston Electric shall not hold out its credit as being available to pay the debt of any affiliates (provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, Houston Electric is not considered to be holding its credit out to pay the debt of affiliates, or in breach of any other ring-fencing measure, with respect to the $68 million of Houston Electric general mortgage bonds that currently serve as collateral for certain outstanding CenterPoint Energy pollution control bonds); •Without prior approval of the PUCT, neither CenterPoint Energy nor any affiliate of CenterPoint Energy (excluding Houston Electric) may incur, guarantee, or pledge assets in respect of any incremental new debt that is dependent on: (1) the revenues of Houston Electric in more than a proportionate degree than the other revenues of CenterPoint Energy; or (2) the equity of Houston Electric; •Houston Electric shall not transfer any material assets or facilities to any affiliates, other than a transfer that is on an arm’s length basis consistent with the PUCT’s affiliate standards applicable to Houston Electric; •Except for its participation in an affiliate money pool, Houston Electric shall not commingle its assets with those of other CenterPoint Energy affiliates;•Except for its participation in an affiliate money pool, Houston Electric shall not lend money to or borrow money from CenterPoint Energy; and•Houston Electric shall notify the PUCT if its issuer credit rating or corporate credit rating as rated by any of the three major rating agencies falls below investment grade.The PUCT approved the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement at its February 14, 2020 open meeting. A final order from the PUCT is currently expected during the first quarter of 2020; however, motions for rehearing, if granted, could result in the order being issued after the first quarter of 2020. The rates are expected to be implemented 45 days after the final order is issued. CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric record pre-tax expense for (i) probable disallowances of capital investments and (ii) customer refund obligations and costs deferred in regulatory assets when the amounts are no longer considered probable of recovery. Brazos Valley Connection Project (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric) Houston Electric completed construction on and energized the Brazos Valley Connection in March 2018, ahead of the original June 1, 2018 energization date. The final capital costs of the project reported to the PUCT in December 2018 were $281 million, which was within the estimated range of approximately $270-$310 million in the PUCT’s original order. In a filing with the PUCT in September 2018, Houston Electric applied for interim recovery of project costs incurred through July 31, 2018, which were not previously included in rates. Houston Electric received approval for interim recovery in November 2018. Final approval of the project costs occurred in Houston Electric’s base rate case discussed above.82Bailey to Jones Creek Project (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric)In April 2017, Houston Electric submitted a proposal to ERCOT requesting its endorsement of the Bailey to Jones Creek Project. On December 12, 2017, Houston Electric received approval from ERCOT. In September 2018, Houston Electric filed a certificate of convenience and necessity application with the PUCT that included capital cost estimates for the project that ranged from approximately $482-$695 million, which were higher than the initial cost estimates. The revised project cost estimates include additional costs associated with the routing of the line to mitigate environmental and other land use impacts and structure design to address soil and coastal wind conditions. The actual capital costs of the project will depend on those factors as well as other factors, including land acquisition costs, construction costs and the ultimate route approved by the PUCT. On the request of the PUCT, ERCOT intervened in the proceeding and performed a re-evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of the proposed project. Based on that re-evaluation, ERCOT reaffirmed the recommended transmission option for the project. An unopposed settlement agreement was filed on August 15, 2019, under which Houston Electric would construct the project at an estimated cost of approximately $483 million. The PUCT issued its final approval of the certificate of convenience and necessity application on November 21, 2019. Houston Electric has commenced pre-construction activities on the project, and anticipates beginning construction in early 2021 and energizing the line in early 2022.Indiana Electric Generation Project (CenterPoint Energy)Indiana Electric must make substantial investments in its generation resources in the near term to comply with environmental regulations. On February 20, 2018, Indiana Electric filed a petition seeking authorization from the IURC to construct a new 700-850 MW natural gas combined cycle generating facility to replace the baseload capacity of its existing generation fleet at an approximate cost of $900 million, which includes the cost of a new natural gas pipeline to serve the plant.As a part of this same proceeding, Indiana Electric also sought recovery under Indiana Senate Bill 251 of costs to be incurred for environmental investments to be made at its F.B. Culley generating plant to comply with ELG and CCR rules. The F.B. Culley investments, estimated to be approximately $95 million, began in 2019 and will allow the F.B. Culley Unit 3 generating facility to comply with environmental requirements and continue to provide generating capacity to Indiana Electric’s customers. Under Indiana Senate Bill 251, Indiana Electric sought authority to recover 80% of the approved costs, including a return, using a tracking mechanism, with the remaining 20% of the costs deferred for recovery in Indiana Electric’s next base rate proceeding.On April 24, 2019, the IURC issued an order approving the environmental investments proposed for the F.B. Culley generating facility, along with recovery of prior pollution control investments made in 2014. The order denied the proposed gas combined cycle generating facility. Indiana Electric is conducting a new IRP, expected to be completed in mid-2020, to identify an appropriate investment of capital in its generation fleet to satisfy the needs of its customers and comply with environmental regulations.Indiana Electric Solar Project (CenterPoint Energy)On February 20, 2018, Indiana Electric announced it was finalizing details to install an additional 50 MW of universal solar energy, consistent with its IRP, with a petition seeking authority to recover costs associated with the project pursuant to Indiana Senate Bill 29. Indiana Electric filed a settlement agreement with the intervening parties whereby the energy produced by the solar farm would be set at a fixed market rate over the life of the investment and recovered within Indiana Electric’s CECA mechanism. On March 20, 2019, the IURC approved the settlement. Indiana Electric reached an agreement with the other settling parties to amend the settlement agreement to ensure the project would not cause negative tax consequences. Indiana Electric filed the amended settlement agreement with the IURC on September 16, 2019, and on January 29, 2020 the IURC approved the amended settlement agreement.Indiana Electric A.B. Brown Ash Pond Remediation (CenterPoint Energy)On August 14, 2019, Indiana Electric filed a petition with the IURC, seeking approval, as a federally mandated project, for the recovery of costs associated with the clean closure of the A.B. Brown ash pond pursuant to Indiana Senate Bill 251. This project, expected to last approximately 14 years, would result in the full excavation and recycling of the ponded ash through agreements with a beneficial reuse entity, totaling approximately $160 million. Under Indiana Senate Bill 251, Indiana Electric seeks authority to recover via a tracking mechanism 80% of the approved costs, with a return on eligible capital investments needed to allow for the extraction of the ponded ash, with the remaining 20% of the costs deferred for recovery in Indiana Electric’s next base rate proceeding. On December 19, 2019 and subsequently on January 10, 2020, Indiana Electric filed a settlement agreement with the intervening parties whereby the costs would be recovered as requested, with an additional commitment by Indiana Electric to offset the federally mandated costs by at least $25 million, representing a combination of total cash proceeds received from the 83ash reuser and total insurance proceeds to be received from Indiana Electric’s insurers in confidential settlement agreements in the pending Complaint for Damages and Declaratory Relief filing. The settlement agreement is pending before the IURC, with an order expected in the first half of 2020. If approved, Indiana Electric would expect recovery of the approved costs to commence in 2021. Rate Change ApplicationsThe Registrants are routinely involved in rate change applications before state regulatory authorities. Those applications include general rate cases, where the entire cost of service of the utility is assessed and reset. In addition, Houston Electric is periodically involved in proceedings to adjust its capital tracking mechanisms (TCOS and DCRF) and annually files to adjust its EECRF. CERC is periodically involved in proceedings to adjust its capital tracking mechanisms in Texas (GRIP), its cost of service adjustments in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma (FRP, RSP, RRA and PBRC, respectively), its decoupling mechanism in Minnesota, and its energy efficiency cost trackers in Arkansas, Minnesota, Mississippi and Oklahoma (EECR, CIP, EECR and EECR, respectively). CenterPoint Energy is periodically involved in proceedings to adjust its capital tracking mechanisms in Indiana (CSIA for gas and TDSIC for Electric) and Ohio (DRR), its decoupling mechanism in Indiana (SRC for gas), and its energy efficiency cost trackers in Indiana (EEFC for gas and DSMA for electric) and Ohio (EEFR).

Approved rates could differ materially from proposed rates.Tax ReformTCJA-related 2018 tax expense refunds are currently included in the Registrants’ existing rates and are therefore reducing the Registrants’ current annual revenue. The TCJA-related 2018 tax expense refunds for Houston Electric were completed in September 2019. However, in Houston Electric’s rate case filed in April 2019, and subsequently adjusted in errata filings in May and June 2019, pursuant to the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement, Houston Electric will return unprotected EDIT net regulatory liability balance to customers, through a separate rider and its wholesale transmission tariff over approximately three years. The balance of unprotected EDIT was $105 million as of December 31, 2018. In addition, Houston Electric’s TCJA-related protected EDIT balance as of December 31, 2018 is $563 million and must be returned to customers over ARAM. CenterPoint Energy’s electric and natural gas utilities in Indiana and Ohio, which were acquired during the Merger, currently recover corporate income tax expense in approved rates charged to customers. The IURC and the PUCO both issued orders which initiated proceedings to investigate the impact of the TCJA on utility companies and customers within Indiana and Ohio, respectively. In addition, the IURC and PUCO have ordered each utility to establish regulatory liabilities to record all estimated impacts of tax reform starting January 1, 2018 until the date when rates are adjusted to capture these impacts.\\xa0In Indiana, in response to Vectren’s pre-Merger filing for proposed changes to its rates and charges to consider the impact of the lower federal income tax rates, the IURC approved an initial reduction to current rates and charges, effective June 1, 2018, to capture the immediate impact of the lower corporate federal income tax rate.\\xa0The refund of EDIT and regulatory liabilities commenced in November 2018 for Indiana electric customers and in January 2019 for Indiana gas customers.\\xa0In Ohio, the initial rate reduction to current rates and charges became effective upon conclusion of its pending base rate case  on August 28, 2019.\\xa0In January 2019, an application was filed with PUCO in compliance with its October 2018 order requiring utilities to file for a request to adjust rates to reflect the impact of the TCJA, requesting authority to implement a rider to flow back to customers the tax benefits realized under the TCJA, including the refund of EDIT and regulatory liabilities.\\xa0CenterPoint Energy expects this proceeding to be approved in 2020.86ELG (CenterPoint Energy)Under the Clean Water Act, the EPA sets technology-based guidelines for water discharges from new and existing electric generation facilities. In September 2015, the EPA finalized revisions to the existing steam electric ELG setting stringent technology-based water discharge limits for the electric power industry. The EPA focused this rulemaking on wastewater generated primarily by pollution control equipment necessitated by the comprehensive air regulations, specifically setting strict water discharge limits for arsenic, mercury and selenium for scrubber waste waters. The ELG will be implemented when existing water discharge permits for the plants are renewed. In the case of Indiana Electric’s water discharge permits, in 2017 the IDEM issued final renewals for the F.B. Culley and A.B. Brown power plants. IDEM agreed that units identified for retirement by December 2023 would not be required to install new treatment technology to meet ELG, and approved a 2020 compliance date for dry bottom ash and a 2023 compliance date for flue gas desulfurization wastewater treatment standards for the remaining coal-fired unit at F.B. Culley.On April 13, 2017, as part of the U.S. President’s Administration’s regulatory reform initiative, which is focused on the number and nature of regulations, the EPA granted petitions to reconsider the ELG rule, and indicated it would stay the current implementation deadlines in the rule during the pendency of the reconsideration. On September 13, 2017, the EPA finalized a rule postponing certain interim compliance dates by two years, but did not postpone the final compliance deadline of December 31, 2023. In April 2018, the EPA published an effluent guidelines program plan that anticipated a December 2019 rule revising the effluent limitations and pre-treatment standards for existing sources in the 2015 rule. On April 12, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated and remanded portions of the ELG rule that selected impoundment as the best available technology for legacy wastewater and leachate. It is not clear what revisions to the ELG rule the EPA will implement, or what effect those revisions may have. As Indiana Electric does not currently have short-term ELG implementation deadlines in its recently renewed wastewater discharge permits, it does not anticipate immediate impacts from the EPA’s two-year extension of preliminary implementation deadlines due to the longer compliance time frames granted by IDEM and will continue to work with IDEM to evaluate further implementation plans. On November 4, 2019, the EPA released a pre-publication copy of proposed revisions to the CCR and ELG rules.\\xa0CenterPoint Energy will evaluate the proposals to determine potential impacts to current compliance plans for its A.B. Brown and F.B. Culley generating stations.CPP and ACE Rule (CenterPoint Energy)On August 3, 2015, the EPA released its CPP Rule, which required a 32% reduction in carbon emissions from 2005 levels. The final rule was published in the Federal Register on October 23, 2015, and that action was immediately followed by litigation ultimately resulting in the U.S. Supreme Court staying implementation of the rule. On August 31, 2018, the EPA published its proposed CPP replacement rule, the ACE Rule, which was finalized on July 8, 2019 and requires states to implement a program of energy efficiency improvement targets for individual coal-fired electric generating units. States have three years to develop state plans to implement the ACE rule, and CenterPoint Energy does not expect a state ACE rule to be finalized and approved by the EPA until 2024. CenterPoint Energy is currently unable to predict the effect of a state plan to implement the ACE rule but does not anticipate that such a plan would have a material effect. Impact of Legislative Actions & Other Initiatives (CenterPoint Energy)At this time, compliance costs and other effects associated with reductions in GHG emissions or obtaining renewable energy sources remain uncertain. While the requirements of a state ACE rule remain uncertain, Indiana Electric will continue to monitor regulatory activity regarding GHG emission standards that may affect its electric generating units.FERC Revised Policy Statement (CenterPoint Energy) The regulation of midstream energy infrastructure assets has a significant impact on Enable’s business. For example, Enable’s interstate natural gas transportation and storage assets are subject to regulation by the FERC under the NGA. In March 2018, the FERC announced a Revised Policy Statement stating that it would no longer allow pipelines organized as a master limited partnership to recover an income tax allowance in their cost-of-service rates. In July 2018, the FERC issued new regulations which required all FERC-regulated natural gas pipelines to make a one-time Form No. 501-G filing providing certain financial information. In October 2018, Enable Gas Transmission, LLC filed its Form No. 501-G and filed a statement that it intended to take no other action. On March 8, 2019, the FERC terminated the 501-G proceeding and required no other action. MRT did not file a FERC Form No. 501-G because it had filed a general rate case in June 2018. In July 2018, the FERC issued an order accepting MRT’s proposed rate increases subject to refund upon a final determination of MRT’s rates and ordering MRT to refile its rate case to reflect the elimination of an income tax allowance in its cost-of-service rates. On August 30, 2018, MRT submitted a supplemental filing to comply with the FERC’s order. MRT has appealed the FERC’s order to eliminate the income tax allowance in its cost-of-service rates. The FERC set MRT’s re-filed rate case for hearing. The procedural schedule has been suspended to afford MRT 87time to file a settlement.  If a settlement is not filed or all of the participants do not agree to a settlement, then the proceeding may advance to hearing. On November 5, 2019, as supplemented on December 13, 2019, MRT filed an uncontested proposed settlement for its 2018 rate case.\\xa0On October 30, 2019, MRT filed a second general rate case with the FERC pursuant to Section 4 of the NGA. The 2019 rate case was necessary because at the time of filing the 2019 rate case, the proposed settlement of the 2018 rate case was still being contested, requiring that new maximum rates be established for the non-settling parties reflecting the turnback of capacity. On November 5, 2019, MRT filed an uncontested proposed settlement for the 2019 rate case. Subsequently, MRT reached agreement with 100% of the parties participating in the MRT rate cases, and these rate case settlements are pending at the FERC. The FERC may accept or reject the proposed settlements in the 2018 and 2019 rate cases as to all of the parties, or may reject one or both of the settlements and set one or both of the rate cases for hearing.Other MattersCredit FacilitiesThe Registrants may draw on their respective revolving credit facilities from time to time to provide funds used for general corporate and limited liability company purposes, including to backstop CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s commercial paper programs. The facilities may also be utilized to obtain letters of credit. For further details related to the Registrants’ revolving credit facilities, please see\\xa0Note 14\\xa0to the consolidated financial statements.Based on the consolidated debt to capitalization covenant in the Registrants’ revolving credit facilities, the Registrants would have been permitted to utilize the full capacity of such revolving credit facilities, which aggregated approximately $5.1 billion as of December 31, 2019.

However, there is no requirement that the borrower makes representations prior to borrowing as to the absence of material adverse changes or litigation that could be expected to have a material adverse effect. Borrowings under each of the revolving credit facilities are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of events of default that we consider customary. The revolving credit facilities also provide for customary fees, including commitment fees, administrative agent fees, fees in respect of letters of credit and other fees. In each of the revolving credit facilities, the spread to LIBOR and the commitment fees fluctuate based on the borrower’s credit rating. The borrowers are currently in compliance with the various business and financial covenants in the five revolving credit facilities.Long-term DebtFor detailed information about the Registrants’ debt issuances in 2019, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.Securities Registered with the SECOn January 31, 2017, the Registrants filed a joint shelf registration statement with the SEC, as amended on September 24, 2018, registering indeterminate principal amounts of Houston Electric’s general mortgage bonds, CERC Corp.’s senior debt securities 88and CenterPoint Energy’s\\xa0senior debt securities and junior subordinated debt securities and an indeterminate number of shares of Common Stock, shares of preferred stock, depositary shares, as well as stock purchase contracts  and equity units. The joint shelf registration statement expired on January 31, 2020. For information related to the Registrants’ debt and equity security issuances in 2019, see Notes 13 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements.Temporary InvestmentsAs of February\\xa019, 2020, the Registrants had no temporary investments. Money Pool The Registrants participate in a money pool through which they and certain of their subsidiaries can borrow or invest on a short-term basis. Funding needs are aggregated and external borrowing or investing is based on the net cash position. The net funding requirements of the CenterPoint Energy money pool are expected to be met with borrowings under CenterPoint Energy’s revolving credit facility or the sale of CenterPoint Energy’s commercial paper. The net funding requirements of the CERC money pool are expected to be met with borrowings under CERC’s revolving credit facility or the sale of CERC’s commercial paper. The money pool may not provide sufficient funds to meet the Registrants’ cash needs. The table below summarizes CenterPoint Energy money pool activity by Registrant as of February\\xa019, 2020: \\xa0Weighted Average Interest Rate\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(in millions)Money pool investments 1.81%\\xa0$282\\xa0$—Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit RatingsThe interest on borrowings under the Registrants’ credit facilities is based on their credit ratings. The interest on borrowings under the credit facilities is based on each respective borrower’s credit ratings. On October 25, 2019, Moody’s downgraded VUHI’s and Indiana Gas’ senior unsecured debt rating to A3 from A2 and SIGECO’s senior secured debt rating to A1 from Aa3. The outlooks of VUHI, Indiana Gas and SIGECO were revised to stable from negative. On November 18, 2019, Moody’s withdrew the ratings of Indiana Gas. On November 21, 2019, Moody’s placed the A3 senior unsecured rating, A3 Issuers rating, and A1 senior secured rating of Houston Electric on review for downgrade. On February 19, 2020, Fitch downgraded Houston Electric’s senior secured debt to A from A+ with a negative outlook and affirmed CenterPoint Energy’s BBB rating with a negative outlook. As of February\\xa019, 2020, Moody’s, S&P and Fitch had assigned the following credit ratings to senior debt of the Registrants:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Moody’s\\xa0S&P\\xa0FitchRegistrant\\xa0Borrower/Instrument\\xa0Rating\\xa0Outlook (1)\\xa0Rating\\xa0Outlook (2)\\xa0Rating\\xa0Outlook (3)CenterPoint Energy\\xa0CenterPoint Energy Senior Unsecured Debt\\xa0Baa2\\xa0Stable\\xa0BBB\\xa0Stable\\xa0BBB\\xa0NegativeCenterPoint Energy\\xa0Vectren Corp.

The Registrants note that these credit ratings 89are included for informational purposes and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold the Registrants’ securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of the Registrants’ credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on the Registrants’ ability to obtain short- and long-term financing, the cost of such financings and the execution of the Registrants’ commercial strategies.A decline in credit ratings could increase borrowing costs under the Registrants’ revolving credit facilities. If the Registrants’ credit ratings had been downgraded one notch by S&P and Moody’s from the ratings that existed as of December\\xa031, 2019, the impact on the borrowing costs under the five revolving credit facilities would have been immaterial. A decline in credit ratings would also increase the interest rate on long-term debt to be issued in the capital markets and could negatively impact the Registrants’ ability to complete capital market transactions and to access the commercial paper market.  Additionally, a decline in credit ratings could increase cash collateral requirements and reduce earnings of CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas Distribution and Energy Services reportable segments.CES, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CERC operating in the\\xa0Energy Services reportable segment, provides natural gas sales and services primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and natural gas utilities throughout the United States. To economically hedge its exposure to natural gas prices, CES uses derivatives with provisions standard for the industry, including those pertaining to credit thresholds. Typically, the credit threshold negotiated with each counterparty defines the amount of unsecured credit that such counterparty will extend to CES. To the extent that the credit exposure that a counterparty has to CES at a particular time does not exceed that credit threshold, CES is not obligated to provide collateral. Mark-to-market exposure in excess of the credit threshold is routinely collateralized by CES.  Similarly, mark-to-market exposure offsetting and exceeding the credit threshold may cause the counterparty to provide collateral to CES.  As of December\\xa031, 2019, the amount posted by CES as collateral aggregated approximately $92 million. Should the credit ratings of CERC Corp. (as the credit support provider for CES) fall below certain levels, CES would be required to provide additional collateral up to the amount of its previously unsecured credit limit. CenterPoint Energy and CERC estimate that as of December\\xa031, 2019, unsecured credit limits extended to CES by counterparties aggregated $467 million, and none of such amount was utilized.Pipeline tariffs and contracts typically provide that if the credit ratings of a shipper or the shipper’s guarantor drop below a threshold level, which is generally investment grade ratings from both Moody’s and S&P, cash or other collateral may be demanded from the shipper in an amount equal to the sum of three months’ charges for pipeline services plus the unrecouped cost of any lateral built for such shipper. If the credit ratings of CERC Corp. decline below the applicable threshold levels, CERC might need to provide cash or other collateral of as much as $181 million as of December\\xa031, 2019. The amount of collateral will depend on seasonal variations in transportation levels.ZENS and Securities Related to ZENS (CenterPoint Energy)If CenterPoint Energy’s creditworthiness were to drop such that ZENS holders thought its liquidity was adversely affected or the market for the ZENS were to become illiquid, some ZENS holders might decide to exchange their ZENS for cash. Funds for the payment of cash upon exchange could be obtained from the sale of the shares of ZENS-Related Securities that CenterPoint Energy owns or from other sources. CenterPoint Energy owns shares of ZENS-Related Securities equal to approximately 100% of the reference shares used to calculate its obligation to the holders of the ZENS. ZENS exchanges result in a cash outflow because tax deferrals related to the ZENS and shares of ZENS-Related Securities would typically cease when ZENS are exchanged or otherwise retired and shares of ZENS-Related Securities are sold. The ultimate tax liability related to the ZENS continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year, and there could be a significant cash outflow when the taxes are paid as a result of the retirement or exchange of the ZENS. If all ZENS had been exchanged for cash on December\\xa031, 2019, deferred taxes of approximately $429 million would have been payable in 2019. If all the ZENS-Related Securities had been sold on December\\xa031, 2019, capital gains taxes of approximately $149 million would have been payable in 2019. For additional information about ZENS, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.Cross DefaultsUnder each of CenterPoint Energy’s, Houston Electric’s and CERC’s respective revolving credit facilities, as well as under CenterPoint Energy’s term loan agreement, a payment default on, or a non-payment default that permits acceleration of, any indebtedness for borrowed money and certain other specified types of obligations (including guarantees) exceeding $125\\xa0million by the borrower or any of their respective significant subsidiaries will cause a default under such borrower’s respective credit facility or term loan agreement. A default by CenterPoint Energy would not trigger a default under its subsidiaries’ debt instruments or revolving credit facilities.90Under each of VUHI’s and VCC’s respective revolving credit facilities and term loan agreements, a payment default on, or a non-payment default that permits acceleration of, any indebtedness for borrowed money and certain other specified types of obligations (including guarantees) exceeding $50 million by the borrower, any of their respective subsidiaries or any of the respective guarantors of a credit facility or term loan agreement will cause a default under such borrower’s respective credit facility or term loan agreement. Possible Acquisitions, Divestitures and Joint VenturesFrom time to time, the Registrants consider the acquisition or the disposition of assets or businesses or possible joint ventures, strategic initiatives or other joint ownership arrangements with respect to assets or businesses. Any determination to take action in this regard will be based on market conditions and opportunities existing at the time, and accordingly, the timing, size or success of any efforts and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable. The Registrants may seek to fund all or part of any such efforts with proceeds from debt and/or equity issuances. Debt or equity financing may not, however, be available to the Registrants at that time due to a variety of events, including, among others, maintenance of our credit ratings, industry conditions, general economic conditions, market conditions and market perceptions.CenterPoint Energy previously disclosed that it may reduce its ownership in Enable over time through sales in the public equity markets, or otherwise, of the Enable common units it holds, subject to market conditions. CenterPoint Energy has no intention to reduce its ownership of Enable common units and currently plans to hold such Enable common units and to utilize any cash distributions received on such Enable common units to finance a portion of CenterPoint Energy’s capital expenditure program. CenterPoint Energy may consider or alter its plans or proposals in respect of any such plans in the future.On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. For further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements.Additionally, on February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020.For further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements.Enable Midstream Partners (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)In September 2018, CERC completed the Internal Spin, after which CERC’s equity investment in Enable met the criteria for discontinued operations classification. As a result, the operations have been classified as Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, in CERC’s Statements of Consolidated Income for the periods presented. For further information, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. CenterPoint Energy receives quarterly cash distributions from Enable on its common units and Enable Series A Preferred Units. A reduction in the cash distributions CenterPoint Energy receives from Enable could significantly impact CenterPoint Energy’s liquidity.  For additional information about cash distributions from Enable, see Notes 11 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements.Hedging of Interest Expense for Future Debt IssuancesFrom time to time, the Registrants may enter into interest rate agreements to hedge, in part, volatility in the U.S. treasury rates by reducing variability in cash flows related to interest payments. For further information, see Note 9(a) to the consolidated financial statements. Weather Hedge (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)CenterPoint Energy and CERC have historically entered into partial weather hedges for certain NGD jurisdictions and electric operations’ Texas service territory to mitigate the impact of fluctuations from normal weather. CenterPoint Energy and CERC remain exposed to some weather risk as a result of the partial hedges. For more information about weather hedges, see Note 9(a) to the consolidated financial statements. 91Collection of Receivables from REPs (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric)Houston Electric’s receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from REPs that supply the electricity Houston Electric distributes to their customers. Before conducting business, a REP must register with the PUCT and must meet certain financial qualifications. Nevertheless, adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for Houston Electric’s services or could cause them to delay such payments. Houston Electric depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis, and any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect Houston Electric’s cash flows. In the event of a REP’s default, Houston Electric’s tariff provides a number of remedies, including the option for Houston Electric to request that the PUCT suspend or revoke the certification of the REP. Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments. However, Houston Electric remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to the replacement REP or the provider of last resort. If a REP were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations and claims might be made against Houston Electric involving payments it had received from such REP. If a REP were to file for bankruptcy, Houston Electric may not be successful in recovering accrued receivables owed by such REP that are unpaid as of the date the REP filed for bankruptcy. However, PUCT regulations authorize utilities, such as Houston Electric, to defer bad debts resulting from defaults by REPs for recovery in future rate cases, subject to a review of reasonableness and necessity. Other Factors that Could Affect Cash RequirementsIn addition to the above factors, the Registrants’ liquidity and capital resources could be affected by:•cash collateral requirements that could exist in connection with certain contracts, including weather hedging arrangements, and natural gas purchases, natural gas price and natural gas storage activities of CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas Distribution and Energy Services reportable segments;\\xa0•acceleration of payment dates on certain gas supply contracts, under certain circumstances, as a result of increased natural gas prices and concentration of natural gas suppliers (CenterPoint Energy and CERC);\\xa0•increased costs related to the acquisition of natural gas (CenterPoint Energy and CERC);\\xa0•increases in interest expense in connection with debt refinancings and borrowings under credit facilities or term loans;\\xa0•various legislative or regulatory actions;\\xa0•incremental collateral, if any, that may be required due to regulation of derivatives (CenterPoint Energy and CERC);\\xa0•the ability of REPs, including REP affiliates of NRG and Vistra Energy Corp., formerly known as TCEH Corp., to satisfy their obligations to CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric; •slower customer payments and increased write-offs of receivables due to higher natural gas prices or changing economic conditions (CenterPoint Energy and CERC);\\xa0•the satisfaction of any obligations pursuant to guarantees;•the outcome of litigation;\\xa0•contributions to pension and postretirement benefit plans;\\xa0•restoration costs and revenue losses resulting from future natural disasters such as hurricanes and the timing of recovery of such restoration costs; and•various other risks identified in “Risk Factors” in Item\\xa01A of Part I of this report. 92Certain Contractual Limits on Our Ability to Issue Securities and Borrow Money Houston Electric has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds, subject to certain exceptions. For information about the total debt to capitalization financial covenants in the Registrants’ and certain of CenterPoint Energy’s subsidiaries’ revolving credit facilities, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESA critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of the Registrants’ financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex accounting estimates. An accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element, item or account in the financial statements. Accounting estimates in the Registrants’ historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events, or the present status of an asset or liability. The accounting estimates described below require the Registrants to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made. Additionally, different estimates that the Registrants could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of their financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The circumstances that make these judgments difficult, subjective and/or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty. The Registrants base their estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments. These estimates may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the Registrants’ operating environment changes. The Registrants’ significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. The Registrants believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates. Accordingly, these accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the Audit Committee of CenterPoint Energy’s Board of Directors.Accounting for Rate RegulationAccounting guidance for regulated operations provides that rate-regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. CenterPoint Energy’s and Houston Electric’s Electric T&D reportable segment, CenterPoint Energy’s Indiana Electric Integrated reportable segment, and CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas Distribution reportable segments apply this accounting guidance. Certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet as regulatory assets or liabilities and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers.\\xa0Regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded when it is probable that these items will be recovered or reflected in future rates.\\xa0Determining probability requires significant judgment on the part of management and includes, but is not limited to, consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings, proposed regulatory decisions, final regulatory orders and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals.\\xa0If events were to occur that would make the recovery of these assets and liabilities no longer probable, the Registrants would be required to write off or write down these regulatory assets and liabilities.\\xa0For further detail on the Registrants’ regulatory assets and liabilities, see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.Acquisition Accounting The Registrants evaluate acquisitions to determine when a set of acquired activities and assets represent a business.\\xa0When control of a business is obtained, the Registrants apply the acquisition method of accounting and record the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest obtained based on fair value at the acquisition date. The fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities subject to rate-setting provisions and earning a regulated return generally approximate their carrying values. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed that are not subject to the rate-setting provisions, including identifiable intangibles, are determined using the income and market approach, which estimation methods may require the use of significant judgment and unobservable inputs, including projected timing and amount of future cash flows and discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the future market prices.  Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.  The results of operations of the acquired business are included in the Registrants’ respective Statements of Consolidated Income beginning on the date of the acquisition.On the Merger Date, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, CenterPoint Energy consummated the Merger and acquired Vectren for approximately $6 billion in cash.  The Merger is being accounted for in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, 93with CenterPoint Energy as the accounting acquirer of Vectren. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at their estimated fair values on the Merger Date.Vectren’s regulated operations, comprised of electric generation and electric and natural gas delivery services, are subject to the rate-setting authority of the FERC, the IURC and the PUCO, and are accounted for pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for regulated operations. The rate-setting and cost-recovery provisions currently in place for Vectren’s regulated operations provide revenues designed to recover the cost of providing utility service and a return on and recovery of investment in rate base assets and liabilities. Thus, the fair values of Vectren’s tangible and intangible assets and liabilities subject to these rate-setting provisions approximate their carrying values.\\xa0Accordingly, neither the assets nor liabilities acquired reflect any adjustments related to these amounts. The fair value of regulatory assets not earning a return have been determined using the income approach and include the use of significant judgment and unobservable inputs.The fair value of Vectren’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed that are not subject to the rate-setting provisions, including identifiable intangibles, and the allocation of fair value to reporting units on the Merger Date was determined under the income approach using the multi-period excess earnings method, which is a specific discounted cash flow income approach, and for the measurement of certain assets and liabilities, the market approach was utilized.\\xa0  Fair value measurements require significant judgment and unobservable inputs, including (i) projected timing and amount of future cash flows, which factor in planned growth initiatives, (ii) the regulatory environment, as applicable, and (iii) discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the future market prices. Determining the discount rates for the non-rate regulated businesses required the estimation of the appropriate company specific risk premiums for those non-rate regulated businesses based on evaluation of industry and entity-specific risks, which included expectations about future market or economic conditions existing on the Merger Date. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the amount of the identified intangible assets and/or the resulting amount of goodwill assigned to each reporting unit. CenterPoint Energy utilized a third-party valuation specialist in determining the key assumptions used in the valuation of intangible assets acquired and the allocation of goodwill to each of its reporting units on the Merger Date.Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, Including Identifiable Intangibles, Goodwill, Equity Method Investments, and Investments without a Readily Determinable Fair ValueThe Registrants review the carrying value of long-lived assets, including identifiable intangibles, goodwill, equity method investments, and investments without a readily determinable fair value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable, and at least annually, goodwill is tested for impairment as required by accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets. \\xa0Unforeseen events, changes in market conditions, and probable regulatory disallowances, where applicable, could have a material effect on the value of long-lived assets, including intangibles, goodwill, equity method investments, and investments without a readily determinable fair value due to changes in observable or estimated market value, future cash flows, interest rate, and regulatory matters could result in an impairment charge. The Registrants recorded no impairments to long-lived assets, including intangibles, equity method investments, or readily determinable fair value during 2019, 2018 and 2017.  CenterPoint Energy and CERC recognized goodwill impairment losses, discussed below, during 2019, and the Registrants recorded no impairments to goodwill in 2018 and 2017.Fair value is the amount at which an asset, liability or business could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques, including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties, present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows, or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures. The fair value could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques.Fair value measurements require significant judgment and unobservable inputs, including (i) projected timing and amount of future cash flows, which factor in planned growth initiatives, (ii) the regulatory environment, as applicable, and (iii) discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the future market prices. Determining the discount rates for the non-rate regulated businesses requires the estimation of the appropriate company specific risk premiums for those non-rate regulated businesses based on evaluation of industry and entity-specific risks, which includes expectations about future market or economic conditions existing on the date of the impairment test. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on results of the impairment tests. CenterPoint Energy and CERC utilized a third-party valuation specialist to determine the key assumptions used in the estimate of fair value for each of its reporting units on the date of its annual goodwill impairment test.Annual goodwill impairment testCenterPoint Energy and CERC completed their 2019 annual goodwill impairment test as of July 1, 2019 and determined, based on an income approach or a weighted combination of income and market approaches, that no goodwill impairment charge 94was required for any reporting unit based on the annual test. The fair values of each reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit, with the exception of CenterPoint Energy’s Indiana Electric Integrated, Infrastructure Services and ESG reporting units. Indiana Electric Integrated’s fair value exceed its carrying value by 13%, and it had total goodwill of $1,008 million as of the 2019 annual impairment test date. Infrastructure Services’ fair value exceeded its carrying values by 6%, and it had total goodwill of $355 million as of the 2019 annual impairment test date. ESG’s fair value exceeded its carrying value by 8%, and it had total goodwill of $127 million as of the 2019 annual impairment test date. These reporting units are comprised entirely of businesses acquired in the Merger in February 2019, when assets and liabilities were adjusted to fair value and as a result, carrying values approximate fair value at that time. The measurement period for the initial purchase price accounting for the reporting units acquired in the Merger, including CenterPoint Energy’s Indiana Electric Integrated, Infrastructure Services and ESG reporting units, remained open as of the date of the annual impairment test date. Upon conclusion of the measurement period in the fourth quarter of 2019, CenterPoint Energy retrospectively evaluated the impact that the measurement period adjustments had on its annual impairment test and identified no material differences to the results, except CenterPoint Energy’s Indiana Electric Integrated’s fair value exceeded its carrying value by 7%, and it had total goodwill of $1,121 million.  The primary driver for the excess fair value in the businesses acquired in the Merger at the annual goodwill impairment test date is a decline in market discounts rates, a key valuation assumption, from February 1, 2019 to July 1, 2019.Although no goodwill impairment resulted from the 2019 annual test, an interim goodwill impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, if CenterPoint Energy’s market capitalization falls below book value for an extended period of time, or events affecting a reporting unit such as a contemplated disposal of all or part of a reporting unit.Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued OperationsGenerally, a long-lived asset to be sold is classified as held for sale in the period in which management, with approval from the Board of Directors, as applicable, commits to a plan to sell and a sale is expected to be completed within one year. The Registrants record assets and liabilities held for sale (the “Disposal Group”) at the lower of their carrying value or their estimated fair value less cost to sell.  If the Disposal Group reflects a component of a reporting unit and meets the definition of a business, the goodwill within that reporting unit is allocated to the disposal group based on the relative fair value of the components representing a business that will be retained and disposed. Goodwill is not allocated to a portion of a reporting unit that does not meet the definition of a business.  A disposal group that meets the held for sale criteria and also represents a strategic shift to the Registrant, is also reflected as discontinued operations on the Statements of Consolidated Income, and prior periods are recast to reflect the earnings or losses from such businesses as income from discontinued operations, net of tax. December 31, 2019 goodwill impairment assessmentsIn connection with its preparation of financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, CenterPoint Energy and CERC, as applicable, identified triggering events for interim goodwill impairment tests at the Infrastructure Services and Energy Services reporting units. Early stage bids received from market participants during the exploration of strategic alternatives for these businesses at year-end indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit was more likely than not below the carrying value.\\xa0As a result, CenterPoint Energy and CERC evaluated long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, and specifically identifiable intangibles subject to amortization, for recoverability and the goodwill within the reporting units were tested for impairment as of December 31, 2019.  The long-lived assets within the Infrastructure Services and Energy Services reporting units were determined to be recoverable based on undiscounted cash flows, considering the likelihood of possible outcomes existing as of December 31, 2019, including the assessment of the likelihood of a future sale of these assets. On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reporting unit. Per the Securities Purchase Agreement, VISCO will be converted from a wholly-owned corporation to a limited liability company that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes immediately prior to the closing of the transaction resulting in the sale of membership units at closing.\\xa0 The sale will be considered an asset sale for tax purposes requiring the net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $123 million within the reporting unit as of December 31, 2019 to be recognized as a benefit to deferred income tax expense by CenterPoint Energy upon closing; therefore, any deferred tax assets and liabilities within the reporting unit are not included in the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities that will be transferred to the buyer. The fair value of the Infrastructure Services reporting unit was estimated as of December 31, 2019 using a market approach utilizing the economic indicators of value received by market participants during the exploration of strategic alternatives to inform the fair value of substantially all of the businesses within this reporting unit as of December 31, 2019.\\xa0 As of December 31, 2019, the fair value of the Infrastructure Services reporting unit exceeded the carrying value (inclusive of deferred income tax liabilities 95of $123 million) by approximately $21 million or 2%. As a result, CenterPoint Energy did not record a goodwill impairment on its Infrastructure Services reporting unit as of December 31, 2019.In February 2020, certain assets and liabilities representing the businesses within the Infrastructure Services reporting unit that will be transferred under the Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Disposal Group”) met the held for sale criteria.  Because the transaction is structured as an asset sale for income tax purposes, the disposal group will exclude the deferred tax liabilities included within the reporting unit.  Upon classifying the Disposal Group as held for sale in the first quarter of 2020, CenterPoint Energy anticipates recording an impairment loss on assets held for sale of approximately $85 million, plus an additional loss for transaction costs, in 2020.  The actual amount of the impairment or loss in 2020 may be materially different from the preliminary amount.The fair value of the Energy Services reporting unit was estimated as of December 31, 2019 using a combination of the market approach and the income approach.  CenterPoint Energy and CERC utilized the economic indicators of value received by market participants during the exploration of strategic alternatives to inform the fair value of substantially all of the businesses within this reporting unit as of December 31, 2019.  Certain assets groups not constituting a business within the reporting unit were valued using an income approach, as there was limited indication of value from market participants as of December 31, 2019 for these assets and liabilities.\\xa0 As a result, Energy Services recognized a goodwill impairment loss of $48 million, the amount by which the carrying value (inclusive of deferred income tax liabilities of $25 million) of the Energy Services reporting unit exceeded its fair value as of December 31, 2019.  Following the impairment, the carrying value of the goodwill remaining in the Energy Services reporting unit is $62 million as of December 31, 2019.On February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reportable segment. This transaction does not include CEIP and its assets. Per the Equity Purchase Agreement, CES will be converted from a wholly-owned corporation to a limited liability company that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes immediately prior to the closing of the transaction resulting in the sale of membership units at closing. The sale will be considered an asset sale for tax purposes requiring the net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $25 million within the reporting unit as of December 31, 2019 to be recognized as a benefit to deferred income tax expense by CenterPoint Energy upon closing; therefore, any deferred tax assets and liabilities within the reporting unit are not included in the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities that will be transferred to the buyer.In February 2020 certain assets and liabilities representing substantially all of the businesses within CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Energy Services reporting unit met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. Because the transaction is structured as an asset sale for income tax purposes, the disposal group will exclude the deferred tax liabilities and certain assets and liabilities within the reporting unit that will be retained by CenterPoint Energy and CERC upon closing.  Upon classifying the disposal group as held for sale in the first quarter of 2020, CenterPoint Energy anticipates recording an aggregate impairment loss on assets held for sale of approximately $80 million, plus an additional loss for transaction costs, in the first quarter of 2020.  The actual amount of the impairment or loss may be materially different from the preliminary amount.For further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements.Equity Method InvestmentsEquity method investments are evaluated for impairment when factors indicate that a decrease in value of an investment has occurred and the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. An impairment loss, based on the excess of the carrying value over the best estimate of fair value of the investment, is recognized in earnings when an impairment is deemed to be other than temporary. Considerable judgment is used in determining if an impairment loss is other than temporary and the amount of any impairment. Based on an analysis of CenterPoint Energy’s investment in Enable as of December 31, 2019, CenterPoint Energy believes that the decline in the value of Enable is temporary, and that the carrying value of its investment of $2.4 billion will be recovered. CenterPoint Energy considers the severity and duration of the impairment, management’s intent and ability to hold the investment to recovery, significant events and conditions of Enable, including its investment grade credit rating and planned expansion projects, along with other factors, to conclude that the investment is not other than temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2019. A sustained low Enable common unit price or further declines in such price could result in CenterPoint Energy recording an impairment charge in future periods. If the decrease in value of CenterPoint Energy’s investment in Enable is determined to be other than temporary, an impairment will be recognized equal to the excess of the carrying value of the investment in Enable over its estimated fair value. Management would evaluate and likely weight both the income approach and market approach to estimate the fair value of the total investment in Enable, which includes CenterPoint Energy’s holdings of Enable common units, general partner interest and incentive distribution rights. The determination of fair value will consider a number of relevant factors including Enable’s 96forecasted results, recent comparable transactions and the limited float of Enable’s publicly traded common units. As of December 31, 2019, the carrying value of CenterPoint Energy’s total investment in Enable was $10.29 per unit. On December 31, 2019, Enable’s common unit price closed at $10.03, based on its publicly traded common units which represent approximately 21% of total outstanding units, (an aggregate of approximately $61 million below carrying value). On February 24, 2020, Enable’s common unit price closed at $7.63 (approximately $622 million below carrying value).Unbilled RevenuesRevenues related to electricity delivery and natural gas sales and services are generally recognized upon delivery to customers. However, the determination of deliveries to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters, which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month either electronically through AMS meter communications or manual readings. At the end of each month, deliveries to non-AMS customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated. Information regarding deliveries to AMS customers after the last billing is obtained from actual AMS meter usage data. Unbilled electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on actual AMS meter data, daily supply volumes and applicable rates.  Unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes, estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect. As additional information becomes available, or actual amounts are determinable, the recorded estimates are revised. Consequently, operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates.Infrastructure Services provides underground pipeline construction and repair services. The contracts are generally less than one year in duration and consist of fixed price, unit, and time and material customer contracts. Under unit or time and material contracts, services are billed to customers monthly or more frequently for work completed based on units completed or the costs of time and material incurred and generally require payment within 30 days of billing. Infrastructure Services has the right to consideration from customers in an amount that corresponds directly with the performance obligation satisfied, and therefore recognizes revenue at a point in time in the amount to which it has the right to invoice, which results in accrued unbilled revenues at the end of each accounting period. Under fixed price contracts, Infrastructure Services performs larger scale construction and repair services. Services performed under fixed price contracts are typically billed per the terms of the contract, which can range from completion of specific milestones to scheduled billing intervals. Billings occur monthly or more frequently for work completed and generally require payment within 30 days of billing. Revenue for fixed price contracts is recognized over time as control is transferred using the input method, considering costs incurred relative to total expected cost. Total expected cost is therefore a significant judgment affecting the amount and timing of revenue recognition. Pension and Other Retirement PlansCenterPoint Energy sponsors pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements. CenterPoint Energy uses several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the expense and liability related to its plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as estimated by management, within certain guidelines. In addition, CenterPoint Energy’s actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension and other retirement plans expense recorded. Please read “—\\xa0Other Significant Matters\\xa0— Pension Plans” for further discussion.\\xa0NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSSee Note 2(u) to the consolidated financial statements, incorporated herein by reference, for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect the Registrants.OTHER SIGNIFICANT MATTERS Pension Plans (CenterPoint Energy).\\xa0\\xa0As discussed in Note 8(b) to the consolidated financial statements, CenterPoint Energy maintains a non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covering eligible employees. Employer contributions for the qualified plan are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under ERISA and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes.\\xa0Under the terms of CenterPoint Energy’s pension plan, it reserves the right to change, modify or terminate the plan. CenterPoint Energy’s funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under ERISA.\\xa097Additionally, CenterPoint Energy maintains unfunded non-qualified benefit restoration plans that allows participants to receive the benefits to which they would have been entitled under the non-contributory qualified pension plan except for the federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated. CenterPoint Energy’s funding requirements and employer contributions for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:\\xa0Year Ended December 31, \\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017CenterPoint Energy(in millions)Minimum funding requirements for qualified pension plans$86\\xa0$60\\xa0$39Employer contributions to the qualified pension plans86\\xa060\\xa039Employer contributions to the non-qualified benefit restoration plans23\\xa09\\xa09CenterPoint Energy expects to contribute a minimum of approximately $76 million to the qualified pension plans and contributions aggregating approximately $7 million to the non-qualified benefit restoration plans in 2020.Changes in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension expense in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income, but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants. As such, significant portions of pension expense recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants.\\xa0As the sponsor of a plan, CenterPoint Energy is required to (a)\\xa0recognize on its Consolidated Balance Sheet  an asset for the plan’s over-funded status or  a liability for the plan’s under-funded status, (b)\\xa0measure a plan’s assets and obligations as of the end of the fiscal year and (c)\\xa0recognize changes in the funded status of the plans in the year that changes occur through adjustments to other comprehensive income and, when related to its rate-regulated utilities with recoverability of cost, to regulatory assets.The projected benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $2.5 billion and $2.0 billion as of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December\\xa031, 2019, the projected benefit obligation exceeded the market value of plan assets of CenterPoint Energy’s pension plans by $448 million. Changes in interest rates or the market values of the securities held by the plan during 2020 could materially, positively or negatively, change the funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions.\\xa0Houston Electric and CERC participate in CenterPoint Energy’s qualified and non-qualified pension plans covering substantially all employees. Pension cost and the impact to pre-tax earnings, after capitalization and regulatory impacts, by Registrant were as follows: \\xa0Year Ended December 31,\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0(in millions)Pension cost $93\\xa0$40\\xa0$35\\xa0$61\\xa0$25\\xa0$22\\xa0$95\\xa0$42\\xa0$35Impact to pre-tax earnings72\\xa023\\xa031\\xa064\\xa027\\xa023\\xa071\\xa023\\xa029The calculation of pension cost and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions. Changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts, and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions. Two of the most critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate.\\xa0As of December\\xa031,\\xa02019, CenterPoint Energy’s qualified pension plans had an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 5.75%, which is 0.25% lower than the 6.00% rate assumed as of December\\xa031, 2018. The expected rate of return assumption was developed using the targeted asset allocation of our plans and the expected return for each asset class. CenterPoint Energy regularly reviews its actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances plan assets to reduce volatility and better match plan assets and liabilities.\\xa0As of December\\xa031,\\xa02019, the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of 3.20%, which is 1.15%  lower than the 4.35% discount rate assumed as of December\\xa031, 2018. The discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on 98high-quality bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations specific to the characteristics of CenterPoint Energy’s plans.\\xa0CenterPoint Energy’s actuarially determined pension and other postemployment expense for 2019 and 2018 that is greater or less than the amounts being recovered through rates in certain Texas jurisdictions is deferred as a regulatory asset or liability, respectively.\\xa0\\xa0Pension cost for 2020, including the nonqualified benefit restoration plan, is estimated to be $45 million, of which CenterPoint Energy expects approximately $52 million to impact pre-tax earnings after effecting such deferrals and capitalization, based on an expected return on plan assets of 5.75% and a discount rate of 3.20% as of December\\xa031, 2019. If the expected return assumption were lowered by 0.50% from 5.75% to 5.25%, 2020 pension cost would increase by approximately $10 million. \\xa0As of December\\xa031, 2019, the pension plans projected benefit obligation, including the unfunded nonqualified pension plans, exceeded plan assets by $448 million.\\xa0\\xa0If the discount rate were lowered by 0.50% from 3.20% to 2.70%, the assumption change would increase CenterPoint Energy’s projected benefit obligation by approximately $127 million and decrease its 2020 pension cost by approximately $5 million. The expected reduction in pension cost due to the decrease in discount rate is a result of the expected correlation between the reduced interest rate and appreciation of fixed income assets in pension plans with significantly more fixed income instruments than equity instruments. In addition, the assumption change would impact CenterPoint Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets by increasing the regulatory asset recorded as of December\\xa031, 2019 by $110 million and would result in a charge to comprehensive income in 2019 of $13 million, net of tax of $4 million, due to the increase in the projected benefit obligation. \\xa0Future changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plans will impact CenterPoint Energy’s future pension expense and liabilities. CenterPoint Energy cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future.Item\\xa07A.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskImpact of Changes in Interest Rates, Equity Prices and Energy Commodity PricesThe Registrants are exposed to various market risks. These risks arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business and are inherent in the Registrants’ consolidated financial statements. Most of the revenues and income from the Registrants’ business activities are affected by market risks. Categories of market risk include exposure to commodity prices through non-trading activities, interest rates and equity prices. A description of each market risk is set forth below:•Interest rate risk primarily results from exposures to changes in the level of borrowings and changes in interest rates.•Equity price risk results from exposures to changes in prices of individual equity securities (CenterPoint Energy).•Commodity price risk results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and price volatilities of commodities, such as natural gas, NGLs and other energy commodities (CenterPoint Energy and CERC).Management has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks. Interest Rate Risk \\xa0 As of December\\xa031, 2019, the Registrants had outstanding long-term debt and lease obligations and CenterPoint Energy had obligations under its ZENS that subject them to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates.  CenterPoint Energy’s floating rate obligations aggregated $3.9 billion and $210 million as of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  If the floating interest rates were to increase by 10% from December\\xa031, 2019 rates, CenterPoint Energy’s combined interest expense would increase by approximately $9 million annually.Houston Electric did not have any floating rate obligations as of either December\\xa031, 2019 or 2018.CERC’s floating rate obligations aggregated $376 million and $210 million as of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, respectively. If the floating interest rates were to increase by 10% from December\\xa031, 2019 rates, CERC’s combined interest expense would increase by approximately $1\\xa0million annually.As of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, CenterPoint Energy had outstanding fixed-rate debt (excluding indexed debt securities) aggregating $11.2 billion and $9.0 billion, respectively, in principal amount and having a fair value of $12.2 billion and $9.2\\xa0billion, 99respectively. Because these instruments are fixed-rate, they do not expose CenterPoint Energy to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates. However, the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately $344 million if interest rates were to decline by 10% from their levels as of December\\xa031, 2019. As of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, Houston Electric had outstanding fixed-rate debt aggregating $5.0 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively, in principal amount and having a fair value of approximately $5.5 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively. Because these instruments are fixed-rate, they do not expose Houston Electric to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates. However, the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately $179 million if interest rates were to decline by 10% from their levels as of December\\xa031, 2019. As of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, CERC had outstanding fixed-rate debt aggregating $2.2 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, in principal amount and having a fair value of $2.5 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. Because these instruments are fixed-rate, they do not expose CERC to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates. However, the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately $77 million if interest rates were to decline by 10% from their levels at December\\xa031, 2019. In general, such an increase in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if the Registrants were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments in the open market prior to their maturity.As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the ZENS obligation is bifurcated into a debt component and a derivative component. The debt component of $19 million at December\\xa031, 2019 was a fixed-rate obligation and, therefore, did not expose CenterPoint Energy to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates. However, the fair value of the debt component would increase by approximately $2 million if interest rates were to decline by 10% from levels at December\\xa031, 2019. Changes in the fair value of the derivative component, a $893 million recorded liability at December\\xa031, 2019, are recorded in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income and, therefore, it is exposed to changes in the fair value of the derivative component as a result of changes in the underlying risk-free interest rate. If the risk-free interest rate were to increase by 10% from December\\xa031, 2019 levels, the fair value of the derivative component liability would decrease by approximately $1 million, which would be recorded as an unrealized gain in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income.Equity Market Value Risk (CenterPoint Energy)CenterPoint Energy is exposed to equity market value risk through its ownership of 10.2 million shares of AT&T Common and 0.9 million shares of Charter Common, which CenterPoint Energy holds to facilitate its ability to meet its obligations under the ZENS. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of CenterPoint Energy’s ZENS obligation. Changes in the fair value of the ZENS-Related Securities held by CenterPoint Energy are expected to substantially offset changes in the fair value of the derivative component of the ZENS. A decrease of 10% from the December\\xa031, 2019 aggregate market value of these shares would result in a net loss of less than $1 million, which would be recorded as a loss on debt securities in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income.Commodity Price Risk From Non-Trading Activities (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)CenterPoint Energy and CERC use derivative instruments as economic hedges to offset the commodity price exposure inherent in their businesses. The commodity risk created by these instruments, including the offsetting impact on the market value of natural gas inventory, is described below. CenterPoint Energy and CERC measure this commodity risk using a sensitivity analysis. For purposes of this analysis, CenterPoint Energy and CERC estimate commodity price risk by applying a $0.50 change in the forward NYMEX price to their net open fixed price position (including forward fixed price physical contracts, natural gas inventory and fixed price financial contracts) at the end of each period. As of\\xa0December\\xa031, 2019, the recorded fair value of CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s non-trading energy derivatives was a net asset of\\xa0$73 million\\xa0(before collateral), all of which is related to CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Energy Services reportable segment. A $0.50 change in the forward NYMEX price would have had a combined impact of\\xa0$13 million on CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s non-trading energy derivatives net asset and the market value of natural gas inventory. Commodity price risk is not limited to changes in forward NYMEX prices. Variation of commodity pricing between the different indices used to mark to market portions of CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s natural gas inventory (Gas Daily) and the related fair value hedge (NYMEX) can result in volatility to CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s net income. Over time, any gains or losses on the sale of storage gas inventory would be offset by gains or losses on the fair value hedges. 100CenterPoint Energy’s regulated operations in Indiana have limited exposure to commodity price risk for transactions involving purchases and sales of natural gas, coal and purchased power for the benefit of retail customers due to current state regulations, which, subject to compliance with those regulations, allow for recovery of the cost of such purchases through natural gas and fuel cost adjustment mechanisms. CenterPoint Energy’s utility natural gas operations in Indiana have regulatory authority to lock in pricing for up to 50% of annual natural gas purchases using arrangements with an original term of up to 10 years. This authority has been utilized to secure fixed price natural gas using both physical purchases and financial derivatives. As of December\\xa031, 2019, the recorded fair value of non-trading energy derivative liabilities was $22 million for CenterPoint Energy’s utility natural gas operations in Indiana, which is offset by a regulatory asset.Although CenterPoint Energy’s regulated operations are exposed to limited commodity price risk, natural gas and coal prices have other effects on working capital requirements, interest costs, and some level of price-sensitivity in volumes sold or delivered. Constructive regulatory orders, such as those authorizing lost margin recovery, other innovative rate designs and recovery of unaccounted for natural gas and other natural gas-related expenses, also mitigate the effect natural gas costs may have on CenterPoint Energy’s financial condition. In 2008, the PUCO approved an exit of the merchant function in CenterPoint Energy’s Ohio natural gas service territory, allowing Ohio customers to purchase substantially all natural gas directly from retail marketers rather than from CenterPoint Energy.101Item\\xa08.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Financial Statements and Supplementary DataREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders ofCenterPoint Energy, Inc.Houston, TexasOpinion on the Financial StatementsWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related statements of consolidated income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.Basis for OpinionThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Acquisitions - Vectren Corporation - Intangible Assets - Refer to Note 4 to the financial statementsCritical Audit Matter DescriptionThe Company completed the acquisition of Vectren Corporation (“Vectren”) for $6 billion in cash on February 1, 2019. The Company accounted for the acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values, including intangible assets and goodwill of $4.6 billion. Of the intangible assets acquired, $297 million was allocated to identifiable intangible assets such as customer relationships and trade name with the remainder of $4.3 billion being recorded as goodwill. Management estimated the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets using the multi-period excess earnings method, which is a specific discounted cash flow method. In addition, the determination of the business fair value required management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to discount rates and future cash flows. Determining the discount rates for the nonregulated businesses acquired required management to estimate the appropriate entity specific risk premiums for those nonregulated businesses based on evaluation of industry and entity-specific risks which included expectations about future market or economic conditions. 102Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on either the amount of the identified intangible assets, the resulting amount of goodwill, or both.Given the fair value determination of intangible assets acquired required management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to the forecasts of future cash flows and the company specific risk premium affecting the discount rate, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort.How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the AuditOur audit procedures related to the forecasts of future cash flows and company specific risk premium affecting the discount rate for the intangible assets of the nonregulated businesses acquired included the following, among others:•We tested the effectiveness of controls over acquisition valuation, including management’s controls over the forecasts of future cash flows and selection of the company specific risk premium assumption used in the determinations of the discount rates.•We considered the impact of changes to the discount rate and long-term growth rate on the fair value.•We evaluated the value at which acquired assets were recorded under the applicable accounting guidance based on the regulated nature of the entity.•We assessed the reasonableness of management’s forecasts by comparing the forecasts to:◦Historical revenues and operating margins.◦Internal communications to management and the Board of Directors.◦Forecasted information included in Company press releases as well as in analyst and industry reports for the Company and certain of its peer companies.•We evaluated whether the estimated future cash flows were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.•We involved our fair value specialists who assisted in:◦Assessing the appropriateness of the valuation methodology used to determine the customer relationship intangible assets and the company specific risk premiums.◦Testing the determined discount rates by independently estimating a discount rate for each business using a process consistent with generally accepted valuation practices.Goodwill - Refer to Note 6 to the financial statementsCritical Audit Matter DescriptionThe Company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. In its annual goodwill impairment test on July 1, 2019 (“measurement date”) and as triggering events are identified, the Company used the discounted cash flow model and a market approach to estimate fair value of each reporting unit, which required management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenues and operating margins based on certain assumptions including (i) future capital expenditures and rate base growth, (ii) estimated future rate changes, (iii) discount rates, and (iv) long-term growth rates. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of a reporting unit, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both. The Company’s goodwill is $5.2 billion as of December 31, 2019, of which $4.3 billion resulted from the acquisition of Vectren. The fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value as of the measurement date and, therefore, no impairment was recognized.Given the significant assumptions used by management to estimate fair value including (i) future capital expenditures and rate base growth, (ii) estimated future rate changes, (iii) discount rates, and (iv) long-term growth rates, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue and operating margin, specifically for reporting units containing unregulated business units and Vectren rate regulated jurisdictions, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve fair value specialists.103How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the AuditOur audit procedures related to the assumptions used to forecast future revenue and operating margin used by management within the discounted cash flow model included the following, among others:•We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over the determination of fair value, such as controls related to management’s forecasts of future capital expenditures, future rate base growth, estimated future rate changes, discount rates, and long-term growth rates.•We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s forecasts by comparing the forecasts to:◦Historical revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, rate base growth, and rate changes.◦Internal communications to management and the Board of Directors.◦Forecasted information included in Company press releases as well as in analyst and industry reports for the Company and certain of its peer companies.•We compared future rate changes to the Company’s scheduled rate filings and the amount of capital expenditures for the regulated entities to communications with regulators including integrated resource plans.•We compared actual revenue growth and capital expenditures results for 2019 to the planned results as of the acquisition date.•We evaluated the impact of changes in management’s forecasts from the measurement date to December 31, 2019.•We involved our fair value specialists who assisted in:◦Assessing the appropriateness of the valuation methodology used to determine the company specific risk premiums in calculating the discount rate.◦Testing the determined discount rates by independently estimating a discount rate for each business using a process consistent with generally accepted valuation practices.◦Evaluating the reasonableness of the long-term growth rate through a comparison to industry reports and peer companies.Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Notes 2 and 7 to the financial statementsCritical Audit Matter DescriptionThe Company, through its regulated electric and gas subsidiaries is subject to rate regulation by the relevant state public utility commissions and, in Texas by the Railroad Commission, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (collectively, “the Commissions”), and those municipalities (in Texas only) served by the Company. Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, such as property, plant, and equipment, net; regulatory assets and liabilities; utility revenues; operation and maintenance expense; and depreciation and amortization expense; and income tax expense.The Company’s rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes by certain municipalities and the Commissions. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the Company’s costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, the Company’s investment in the utility business. Regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investment, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. The regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Decisions to be made by the Commissions in the future will impact the accounting for regulated operations, including decisions about the amount of allowable costs and return on invested capital included in rates and any refunds that may be required. While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment.104We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about affected account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory actions on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs, (2) a disallowance of capital investments made by the Company and (3) refunds to customers. Given that management’s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due its inherent complexities.How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the AuditOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:•We tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) refund or future reductions in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.•We evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.•For matters with a high degree of subjectivity, we read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the Company and other public utilities in the states the Company operates in, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by interveners, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedence of the Commissions’ treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared to management’s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.•For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company’s filings with the Commission and the filings with the Commission by intervenors that may impact the Company’s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions.•We evaluated management’s plans regarding property, plant, and equipment for indications of potential impairment. We inspected the capital-projects budget and inquired of management to identify projects that are designed to replace assets that may be retired prior to the end of the useful life. We inspected minutes of the board of directors and regulatory orders and other filings with the Commissions to identify any evidence that may contradict management’s assertion regarding probability of a disallowance of long-lived assets.•We evaluated regulatory filings for any evidence that intervenors are challenging full recovery of the cost of any capital projects and inquired of management to assess whether capitalized costs are probable of disallowance. •We obtained an analysis from management regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management’s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates./s/ DELOITTE\\xa0& TOUCHE LLPHouston, TexasFebruary 27, 2020\\xa0We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1932.105CENTERPOINT ENERGY, INC.

As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion./s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLPHouston, Texas\\xa0\\xa0February 27, 2020\\xa0\\xa0We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1997.118CENTERPOINT ENERGY RESOURCES CORP.

AND SUBSIDIARIESCENTERPOINT ENERGY HOUSTON ELECTRIC, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIESCENTERPOINT ENERGY RESOURCES CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIESCOMBINED NOTES\\xa0TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(1)   Background General. This combined Form 10-K is filed separately by three registrants: CenterPoint Energy, Inc., CenterPoint Energy Houston Electric, LLC and CenterPoint Energy Resources Corp. Information contained herein relating to any individual registrant is filed by such registrant solely on its own behalf. Each registrant makes no representation as to information relating exclusively to the other Registrants or the subsidiaries of CenterPoint Energy other than itself or its subsidiaries. Except as discussed in Note 14 to the Registrants’ Consolidated Financial Statements, no registrant has an obligation in respect of any other Registrant’s debt securities, and holders of such debt securities should not consider the financial resources or results of operations of any Registrant other than the obligor in making a decision with respect to such securities.Included in this combined Form 10-K are the Financial Statements of CenterPoint Energy, Houston Electric and CERC, which are referred to collectively as the Registrants. The Combined Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements apply to all Registrants and specific references to Houston Electric and CERC herein also pertain to CenterPoint Energy, unless otherwise indicated.Background. CenterPoint Energy, Inc. is a public utility holding company and owns interests in Enable as described below. On the Merger Date, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, CenterPoint Energy consummated the previously announced Merger and acquired Vectren for approximately $6 billion in cash. On the Merger Date, Vectren became a wholly-owned subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy. As of December\\xa031, 2019, CenterPoint Energy’s operating subsidiaries were as follows:•Houston Electric owns and operates electric transmission and distribution facilities in the Texas Gulf Coast area that includes the city of Houston; and•CERC Corp. (i) owns and operates natural gas distribution systems in six states and (ii) obtains and offers competitive variable and fixed-price physical natural gas supplies and services primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and natural gas utilities in over 30 states through its wholly-owned subsidiary, CES. •Vectren holds three public utilities through its wholly-owned subsidiary, VUHI, a public utility holding company:•Indiana Gas provides energy delivery services to natural gas customers located in central and southern Indiana;•SIGECO provides energy delivery services to electric and natural gas customers located near Evansville in southwestern Indiana and owns and operates electric generation assets to serve its electric customers and optimizes those assets in the wholesale power market; and•VEDO provides energy delivery services to natural gas customers located near Dayton in west-central Ohio.•Vectren performs non-utility activities through:•Infrastructure Services, which provides underground pipeline construction and repair services through wholly-owned subsidiaries Miller Pipeline, LLC and Minnesota Limited, LLC and serves natural gas utilities across the United States, focusing on recurring integrity, station and maintenance work and opportunities for large transmission pipeline construction projects; and•ESG, which provides energy performance contracting and sustainable infrastructure services, such as renewables, distributed generation and combined heat and power projects.For a description of CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s reportable segments, see Note 19. Houston Electric consists of a single reportable segment, Houston Electric T&D.125As of December\\xa031, 2019, CenterPoint Energy, indirectly through CNP Midstream, owned approximately 53.7% of the common units representing limited partner interests in Enable, 50% of the management rights and 40% of the incentive distribution rights in Enable GP and also directly owned an aggregate of 14,520,000 Enable Series A Preferred Units. Enable owns, operates and develops natural gas and crude oil infrastructure assets.On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020.  For further information, see Notes 6 and 23.Additionally, on February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. For further information, see Notes 6 and 23. (2)   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  (a)Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.(b)Principles of ConsolidationThe accounts of the Registrants and their wholly-owned and majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation, except as described below. Businesses within the Infrastructure Services reportable segment provide underground pipeline construction and repair services for customers that include NGD utilities. In accordance with consolidation guidance in ASC 980—Regulated Operations, costs incurred by NGD utilities for these pipeline construction and repair services are not eliminated in consolidation when capitalized and included in rate base by the NGD utility. Fees incurred by CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD for pipeline construction and repair services that were capitalized totaled $162 million and $20 million, respectively, for the 11 months ended December 31, 2019.  On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020.  For further information, see Notes 6 and 23.As of December\\xa031, 2019, CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric had VIEs consisting of the Bond Companies, which are consolidated. The consolidated VIEs are wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote special purpose entities that were formed solely for the purpose of securitizing transition and system restoration related property. Creditors of CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric have no recourse to any assets or revenues of the Bond Companies. The bonds issued by these VIEs are payable only from and secured by transition and system restoration property and the bondholders have no recourse to the general credit of CenterPoint Energy or Houston Electric. (c)Equity and Investments without a Readily Determinable Fair Value (CenterPoint Energy)\\xa0CenterPoint Energy generally uses the equity method of accounting for investments in entities in which it has an ownership interest between 20% and 50% and exercises significant influence. CenterPoint Energy also uses the equity method for investments in which it has ownership percentages greater than 50%, when it exercises significant influence, does not have control and is not considered the primary beneficiary, if applicable. Under the equity method, CenterPoint Energy adjusts its investments each period for contributions made, distributions received, respective shares of comprehensive income and amortization of basis differences, as appropriate. CenterPoint Energy evaluates its equity method investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate there is a loss in value of the investment that is other than a temporary decline.  126CenterPoint Energy considers distributions received from equity method investments which do not exceed cumulative equity in earnings subsequent to the date of investment to be a return on investment and classifies these distributions as operating activities in its Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows. CenterPoint Energy considers distributions received from equity method investments in excess of cumulative equity in earnings subsequent to the date of investment to be a return of investment and classifies these distributions as investing activities in its Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.Investments without a readily determinable fair value will be measured at cost, less impairment, plus or minus observable prices changes of an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.(d)RevenuesThe Registrants record revenue for electricity delivery and natural gas sales and services under the accrual method and these revenues are recognized upon delivery to customers. Electricity deliveries not billed by month-end are accrued based on actual AMS data, daily supply volumes and applicable rates. Natural gas sales not billed by month-end are accrued based upon estimated purchased gas volumes, estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and currently effective tariff rates. Revenue for some pipeline construction services are based on the percentage of completion method. For further discussion, see Note 5.(e) MISO TransactionsIndiana Electric is a member of the MISO. MISO-related purchase and sale transactions are recorded using settlement information provided by the MISO. These purchase and sale transactions are accounted for on at least a net hourly position, meaning net purchases within that interval are recorded on CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income in Utility natural gas, fuel and purchased power, and net sales within that interval are recorded on CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income in Utility revenues. On occasion, prior period transactions are resettled outside the routine process due to a change in the MISO’s tariff or a material interpretation thereof. Expenses associated with resettlements are recorded once the resettlement is probable and the resettlement amount can be estimated. Revenues associated with resettlements are recognized when the amount is determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.(f) GuaranteesCenterPoint Energy recognizes guarantee obligations at fair value. CenterPoint Energy discloses parent company guarantees of a subsidiary’s obligation when that guarantee results in the exposure of a material obligation of the parent company even if the probability of fulfilling such obligation is considered remote. See Note 16(c) and (d). \\xa0(g) Long-lived Assets, Goodwill and IntangiblesThe Registrants record property, plant and equipment at historical cost and expense repair and maintenance costs as incurred.The Registrants periodically evaluate long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, and specifically identifiable intangibles subject to amortization, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable.  For rate regulated businesses, recoverability of long-lived assets is assessed by determining if a capital disallowance from a regulator is probable through monitoring the outcome of rate cases and other proceedings.  For non-rate regulated businesses, recoverability is assessed based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets compared to the carrying value of the assets.  As of December 31, 2019, CenterPoint Energy and CERC, as applicable, determined that the carrying value of long-lived and intangible assets associated with the Infrastructure Services and Energy Services reporting units were recoverable based on undiscounted cash flows, considering the likelihood of possible outcomes existing as of that date, including the assessment of the likelihood of a future sale of these assets.  No long-lived asset or intangible asset impairments were recorded in 2019, 2018 or 2017. CenterPoint Energy and CERC perform goodwill impairment tests at least annually and evaluate goodwill when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. Subsequent to the Registrant’s adoption of ASU 2017-04 Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment on January 1, 2018, CenterPoint Energy and CERC recognize a goodwill impairment by the amount a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill within that reporting unit. CenterPoint Energy includes deferred tax assets and liabilities within its reporting unit’s carrying value for the purposes of annual and interim impairment tests, regardless of whether the estimated fair value reflects the disposition of such assets and liabilities. For further information about the goodwill impairment tests during 2019, see Note 6.127(h) Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued OperationsGenerally, a long-lived asset to be sold is classified as held for sale in the period in which management, with approval from the Board of Directors, as applicable, commits to a plan to sell and a sale is expected to be completed within one year.  The Registrants record assets and liabilities held for sale at the lower of their carrying value or their estimated fair value less cost to sell.  If the disposal group reflects a component of a reporting unit and meets the definition of a business, the goodwill within that reporting unit is allocated to the disposal group based on the relative fair value of the components representing a business that will be retained and disposed. Goodwill is not allocated to a portion of a reporting unit that does not meet the definition of a business.  A disposal group that meets the held for sale criteria and also represents a strategic shift to the Registrant, is also reflected as discontinued operations on the Statements of Consolidated Income, and prior periods are recast to reflect the earnings or losses from such businesses as income from discontinued operations, net of tax. (i) Regulatory Assets and LiabilitiesThe Registrants apply the guidance for accounting for regulated operations to the Houston Electric T&D reportable segment, Indiana Electric Integrated segment and the Natural Gas Distribution reportable segment. The Registrants’ rate-regulated subsidiaries may collect revenues subject to refund pending final determination in rate proceedings. In connection with such revenues, estimated rate refund liabilities are recorded which reflect management’s current judgment of the ultimate outcomes of the proceedings. The Registrants’ rate-regulated businesses recognize removal costs as a component of depreciation expense in accordance with regulatory treatment. In addition, a portion of the amount of removal costs collected from customers that relate to AROs has been reflected as an asset retirement liability in accordance with accounting guidance for AROs.For further detail on the Registrants’ regulatory assets and liabilities, see Note 7.(j) Depreciation and Amortization ExpenseThe Registrants compute depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method based on economic lives or regulatory-mandated recovery periods. Amortization expense includes amortization of certain regulatory assets and other intangibles.(k) Capitalization of Interest and AFUDCThe Registrants capitalize interest and AFUDC as a component of projects under construction and amortize it over the assets’ estimated useful lives once the assets are placed in service. AFUDC represents the composite interest cost of borrowed funds and a reasonable return on the equity funds used for construction for subsidiaries that apply the guidance for accounting for regulated operations. Although AFUDC increases both utility plant and earnings, it is realized in cash when the assets are included in rates.  \\xa0Year Ended December\\xa031,\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0(in millions)Interest and AFUDC debt (1)$36\\xa0$8\\xa0$3\\xa0$8\\xa0$6\\xa0$2\\xa0$9\\xa0$6\\xa0$2AFUDC equity (2)22\\xa015\\xa03\\xa012\\xa010\\xa02\\xa011\\xa010\\xa01(1)Included in Interest and other finance charges on the Registrants’ respective Statements of Consolidated Income.(2)Included in Other Income (Expense) on the Registrants’ respective Statements of Consolidated Income.(l) Income TaxesHouston Electric and CERC are included in CenterPoint Energy’s U.S. federal consolidated income tax return. Houston Electric and CERC report their income tax provision on a separate entity basis pursuant to a tax sharing agreement with CenterPoint Energy.\\xa0Current federal and certain state income taxes are payable to or receivable from CenterPoint Energy.The Registrants use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. A valuation allowance is established against deferred tax 128assets for which management believes realization is not considered to be more likely than not. The Registrants recognize interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense (benefit), as applicable, in their respective Statements of Consolidated Income. CenterPoint Energy reports the income tax provision associated with its interest in Enable in income tax expense (benefit) in its Statements of Consolidated Income.On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law comprehensive tax reform legislation informally called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts, or TCJA, which resulted in significant changes to federal tax laws effective January 1, 2018.\\xa0See Note 15 for further discussion of the impacts of tax reform implementation. To the extent certain EDIT of the Registrants’ rate-regulated subsidiaries may be recoverable or payable through future rates, regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded, respectively. The Registrants use the portfolio approach to recognize income tax effects on other comprehensive income from accumulated other comprehensive income.Investment tax credits are deferred and amortized to income over the approximate lives of the related property.(m) Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful AccountsAccounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Management reviews the outstanding accounts receivable, as well as the bad debt write-offs experienced in the past, and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when management determines it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. The table below summarizes the Registrants’ provision for doubtful accounts for 2019, 2018 and 2017:\\xa0Year Ended December\\xa031,\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0(in millions)Provision for doubtful accounts$16\\xa0$—\\xa0$12\\xa0$16\\xa0$—\\xa0$16\\xa0$14\\xa0$1\\xa0$13(n) InventoryThe Registrants’ inventory consists principally of materials and supplies, and for CERC, natural gas, and for CenterPoint Energy, coal inventory. Materials and supplies are valued at the lower of average cost or market.\\xa0Materials and supplies are recorded to inventory when purchased and subsequently charged to expense or capitalized to plant when installed. Natural gas inventories of CERC’s Energy Services reportable segment at locations qualifying for and utilizing the fair value hedge accounting election are valued at fair value; inventories at locations not qualifying for or not utilizing the fair value hedge accounting election are valued at the lower of average cost or market. During 2019, 2018 and 2017, CERC recorded write-downs of natural gas inventory to the lower of average cost or market which are disclosed on the respective Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.(o) Derivative InstrumentsThe Registrants are exposed to various market risks. These risks arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business.\\xa0The Registrants utilize derivative instruments such as physical forward contracts, swaps and options to mitigate the impact of changes in commodity prices, weather and interest rates on operating results and cash flows. Such derivatives are recognized in the Registrants’ Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value unless the Registrant elects the normal purchase and sales exemption for qualified physical transactions. A derivative may be designated as a normal purchase or normal sale if the intent is to physically receive or deliver the product for use or sale in the normal course of business. CenterPoint Energy and CERC have elected to record changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness immediately in their Statements of Consolidated Income.CenterPoint Energy has a Risk Oversight Committee composed of corporate and reportable segment officers that oversees commodity price, weather and credit risk activities, including the Registrants’ marketing, risk management services and hedging activities. The committee’s duties are to establish the Registrants’ commodity risk policies, allocate board-approved commercial risk limits, approve the use of new products and commodities, monitor positions and ensure compliance with the Registrants’ risk 129management policies and procedures and limits established by CenterPoint Energy’s Board of Directors. The Registrants’ policies prohibit the use of leveraged financial instruments. A leveraged financial instrument, for this purpose, is a transaction involving a derivative whose financial impact will be based on an amount other than the notional amount or volume of the instrument.(p) Investments in Equity Securities (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)CenterPoint Energy and CERC report equity securities at estimated fair value in their respective Consolidated Balance Sheets, and any unrealized holding gains and losses are recorded as Other Income (Expense) in their respective Statements of Consolidated Income.(q) Environmental CostsThe Registrants expense or capitalize environmental expenditures, as appropriate, depending on their future economic benefit. The Registrants expense amounts that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations that do not have future economic benefit. The Registrants record undiscounted liabilities related to these future costs when environmental assessments and/or remediation activities are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.(r) Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted CashFor purposes of reporting cash flows, the Registrants consider cash equivalents to be short-term, highly-liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase. Cash and cash equivalents held by the Bond Companies (VIEs) solely to support servicing the Securitization Bonds as of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018 are reflected on CenterPoint Energy’s and Houston Electric’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.In connection with the issuance of Securitization Bonds, CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric were required to establish restricted cash accounts to collateralize the bonds that were issued in these financing transactions. These restricted cash accounts are not available for withdrawal until the maturity of the bonds and are not included in cash and cash equivalents. For more information on restricted cash see Note 20. (s) Preferred Stock and Dividends Preferred stock is evaluated to determine balance sheet classification, and all conversion and redemption features are evaluated for bifurcation treatment. Proceeds received net of issuance costs are recognized on the settlement date. Cash dividends become a liability once declared. Income available to common stockholders is computed by deducting from net income the dividends accumulated and earned during the period on cumulative preferred stock.(t) Purchase AccountingThe Registrants evaluate acquisitions to determine when a set of acquired activities and assets represent a business.\\xa0When control of a business is obtained, the Registrants apply the acquisition method of accounting and record the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest obtained based on fair value at the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of the acquired business are included in the Registrants’ respective Statements of Consolidated Income beginning on the date of the acquisition.(u) New Accounting PronouncementsThe following table provides an overview of certain recently adopted or issued accounting pronouncements applicable to all the Registrants, unless otherwise noted.Recently Adopted Accounting StandardsASU Number and Name\\xa0Description\\xa0Date of Adoption\\xa0Financial Statement Impactupon AdoptionASU 2016-02- Leases (Topic 842) and related amendments\\xa0ASU 2016-02 provides a comprehensive new lease model that requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases and would change certain aspects of lessor accounting.Transition method:\\xa0modified retrospective\\xa0January 1, 2019\\xa0The Registrants adopted the standard and recognized a right-of-use asset and lease liability on their statement of financial position with no material impact on their results of operations and cash flows. See Note 22 for more information.130Issued, Not Yet Effective Accounting StandardsASU Number and Name\\xa0Description\\xa0Effective Date\\xa0Financial Statement Impactupon AdoptionASU 2016-13- Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\\xa0This standard, including standards amending this standard, requires a new model called CECL to estimate credit losses for (1) financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost and (2) certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. Upon initial recognition of the exposure, the CECL model requires an entity to estimate the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure based on historical information, current information and reasonable and supportable forecasts, including estimates of prepayments. Transition method:\\xa0modified retrospective\\xa0January 1, 2020Early adoption is permitted\\xa0The adoption of this standard will result in an immaterial adjustment to the carrying value of the Registrants’ accounts receivable, net. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the Registrants’ financial position, results of operations or cash flows.ASU 2018-13- Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement  \\xa0This standard eliminates, modifies and adds certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements.Transition method: prospective for additions and one modification and retrospective for all other amendments\\xa0Adoption of eliminations and modifications as of September 30, 2018; Additions will be adopted January 1, 2020\\xa0The adoption of this standard did not impact the Registrants’ financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Note 10 reflects the disclosures modified upon adoption. ASU 2018-15-Intangibles-Goodwill and Other- Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract\\xa0This standard aligns accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is accounted for as a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The update also prescribes the balance sheet, income statement and cash flow classification of the capitalized implementation costs and related amortization expense and requires additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures.Transition method: retrospective or prospective\\xa0January 1, 2020Early adoption is permitted\\xa0The adoption of this standard will require the Registrants to capitalize certain costs to implement cloud computing arrangements that are accounted for as service contracts within Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Registrants’ consolidated balance sheets and record the amortization of such assets within Operation and maintenance expenses on the Registrants’ statements of consolidated income. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the Registrants’ financial position, results of operations, cash flows or disclosures.Management believes that other recently adopted standards and recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on the Registrants’ financial position, results of operations or cash flows upon adoption.(3)   Property, Plant and Equipment (a) Property, Plant and EquipmentProperty, plant and equipment includes the following:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0December\\xa031, 2019\\xa0December\\xa031, 2018\\xa0Weighted Average Useful Lives\\xa0Property, Plant and Equipment, Gross\\xa0Accumulated Depreciation & Amortization\\xa0Property, Plant and Equipment, Net\\xa0Property, Plant and Equipment, Gross\\xa0Accumulated Depreciation & Amortization\\xa0Property, Plant and Equipment, Net\\xa0(in years)\\xa0(in millions)CenterPoint Energy\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Electric Transmission & Distribution 37\\xa0$14,360\\xa0$4,634\\xa0$9,726\\xa0$12,148\\xa0$3,746\\xa0$8,402Electric Generation (1)27\\xa01,780\\xa0698\\xa01,082\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0—Natural Gas Distribution29\\xa012,695\\xa03,731\\xa08,964\\xa07,257\\xa02,128\\xa05,129Energy Services (2)27\\xa0136\\xa053\\xa083\\xa0121\\xa043\\xa078Infrastructure Services (3)10\\xa0317\\xa022\\xa0295\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0—Other property19\\xa01,397\\xa0602\\xa0795\\xa0741\\xa0306\\xa0435Total \\xa0\\xa0$30,685\\xa0$9,740\\xa0$20,945\\xa0$20,267\\xa0$6,223\\xa0$14,044Houston Electric\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Electric Transmission46\\xa0$3,358\\xa0$674\\xa0$2,684\\xa0$3,077\\xa0$650\\xa0$2,427Electric Distribution35\\xa07,876\\xa02,586\\xa05,290\\xa07,524\\xa02,553\\xa04,971Other transmission & distribution property19\\xa01,595\\xa0537\\xa01,058\\xa01,547\\xa0543\\xa01,004Total\\xa0\\xa0$12,829\\xa0$3,797\\xa0$9,032\\xa0$12,148\\xa0$3,746\\xa0$8,402\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0131\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0December\\xa031, 2019\\xa0December\\xa031, 2018\\xa0Weighted Average Useful Lives\\xa0Property, Plant and Equipment, Gross\\xa0Accumulated Depreciation & Amortization\\xa0Property, Plant and Equipment, Net\\xa0Property, Plant and Equipment, Gross\\xa0Accumulated Depreciation & Amortization\\xa0Property, Plant and Equipment, Net\\xa0(in years)\\xa0(in millions)CERC\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Natural Gas Distribution29\\xa0$7,933\\xa0$2,208\\xa0$5,725\\xa0$7,257\\xa0$2,128\\xa0$5,129Energy Services (2)27\\xa0136\\xa053\\xa083\\xa0121\\xa043\\xa078Other property16\\xa055\\xa027\\xa028\\xa053\\xa034\\xa019Total \\xa0\\xa0$8,124\\xa0$2,288\\xa0$5,836\\xa0$7,431\\xa0$2,205\\xa0$5,226(1)SIGECO and AGC own a 300 MW unit at the Warrick Power Plant (Warrick Unit 4) as tenants in common.

AGC and SIGECO share equally in the cost of operation and output of the unit. SIGECO’s share of operating costs is included in Operation and maintenance expense in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income.(2)On February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. For further information, see Notes 6 and 23. (3)On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reportable segment.

CenterPoint Energy recorded AROs relating to the closure of the ash ponds at A.B. Brown and F.B. Culley. CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric also recorded AROs relating to treated wood poles for electric distribution, distribution transformers containing PCB (also known as Polychlorinated Biphenyl), and underground fuel storage tanks. CenterPoint Energy and CERC also recorded AROs relating to gas pipelines abandoned in place. The estimates of future liabilities were developed using historical information, and where available, quoted prices from outside contractors.132A reconciliation of the changes in the ARO liability recorded in Other non-current liabilities on each of the Registrants’ respective Consolidated Balance Sheets is as follows:\\xa0December\\xa031, 2019\\xa0December\\xa031, 2018\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0(in millions)Beginning balance$258\\xa0$34\\xa0$221\\xa0$281\\xa0$35\\xa0$243Addition from Merger with Vectren116\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0—Accretion expense (1)16\\xa01\\xa010\\xa010\\xa01\\xa09Revisions in estimates (2)149\\xa07\\xa094\\xa0(33)\\xa0(2)\\xa0(31)Ending balance$539\\xa0$42\\xa0$325\\xa0$258\\xa0$34\\xa0$221(1)Reflected in Regulatory assets on each of the Registrants’ respective Consolidated Balance Sheets.(2)In 2019, the Registrants reflected an increase in their respective ARO liability, which is primarily attributable to decreases in the long-term interest rates used for discounting in the ARO calculation and increased estimated closure costs for CenterPoint Energy’s electric generation. In 2018, CenterPoint Energy and CERC reflected a decrease in their respective ARO liability, which is primarily attributable to increases in the long-term interest rates used for discounting in the ARO calculation. (4)   Mergers and Acquisitions (CenterPoint Energy) Merger with Vectren. On the Merger Date, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, CenterPoint Energy consummated the previously announced Merger and acquired Vectren for approximately $6 billion in cash. Each share of Vectren common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing was canceled and converted into the right to receive $72.00 in cash per share, without interest. At the closing, each stock unit payable in Vectren common stock or whose value is determined with reference to the value of Vectren common stock, whether vested or unvested, was canceled with cash consideration paid in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. These amounts did not include a stub period cash dividend of $0.41145 per share, which was declared, with CenterPoint Energy’s consent, by Vectren’s board of directors on January\\xa016, 2019, and paid to Vectren stockholders as of the record date of February\\xa01, 2019. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement and immediately subsequent to the close of the Merger, CenterPoint Energy cash settled $78 million in outstanding share-based awards issued prior to the Merger Date by Vectren to its employees.\\xa0As a result of the Merger, CenterPoint Energy assumed a liability for these share-based awards of $41 million and recorded an incremental cost of $37 million in Operation and maintenance expenses on its Statements of Consolidated Income during the year ended December\\xa031, 2019 for the accelerated vesting of the awards in accordance with the Merger Agreement. Subsequent to the close of the Merger, CenterPoint Energy recognized severance totaling $61 million to employees terminated immediately subsequent to the Merger close, inclusive of change of control severance payments to executives of Vectren under existing agreements, and which is included in Operation and maintenance expenses on its Statements of Consolidated Income during the year ended December\\xa031, 2019. Total severance cost for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $102 million.In connection with the Merger, VUHI and VCC made offers to prepay certain outstanding guaranteed senior notes as required pursuant to certain note purchase agreements previously entered into by VUHI and VCC. See Note 14 for further details.Following the closing, shares of Vectren common stock, which previously traded under the ticker symbol “VVC” on the NYSE, ceased trading on and were delisted from the NYSE.The Merger is being accounted for in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, with CenterPoint Energy as the accounting acquirer of Vectren. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at their estimated fair values on the Merger Date. Vectren’s regulated operations, comprised of electric generation and electric and natural gas energy delivery services, are subject to the rate-setting authority of the FERC, the IURC and the PUCO, and are accounted for pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for regulated operations. The rate-setting and cost-recovery provisions currently in place for Vectren’s regulated operations provide revenues derived from costs including a return on investment of assets and liabilities included in rate base. Thus, the fair value of Vectren’s tangible and intangible assets and liabilities subject to these rate-setting 133provisions approximate their carrying values on the Merger Date.\\xa0 The fair value of regulatory assets not earning a return have been determined using the income approach and are considered Level 3 fair value measurements due to the use of significant judgmental and unobservable inputs.The fair value of Vectren’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed that are not subject to the rate-setting provisions, including identifiable intangibles, have been determined using the income approach and the market approach.\\xa0The valuation of Vectren’s long-term debt is primarily considered a Level 2 fair value measurement. All other valuations are considered Level 3 fair value measurements due to the use of significant judgmental and unobservable inputs, including projected timing and amount of future cash flows and discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the future market prices.The following table presents the purchase price allocation as of December\\xa031, 2019 (in millions):Cash and cash equivalents\\xa0$16Other current assets\\xa0577Property, plant and equipment, net\\xa05,147Identifiable intangibles \\xa0297Regulatory assets\\xa0338Other assets\\xa0141Total assets acquired\\xa06,516Current liabilities\\xa0648Regulatory liabilities\\xa0938Other liabilities\\xa0886Long-term debt\\xa02,401Total liabilities assumed\\xa04,873Net assets acquired\\xa01,643Goodwill\\xa04,339Total purchase price consideration\\xa0$5,982CenterPoint Energy completed a final valuation analysis necessary to determine the fair market values of all of Vectren’s assets and liabilities and the allocation of its purchase price. Changes from the preliminary purchase price allocation originally reported in the first quarter of 2019 primarily included additional information obtained related to intangible assets and the allocation of the fair value between reporting units.The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill, which is primarily attributable to significant potential strategic benefits to CenterPoint Energy, including growth opportunities for more rate-regulated investment, more customers for existing products and services and additional products and services for existing customers. Additionally, CenterPoint Energy believes the Merger will increase geographic and business diversity as well as scale in attractive jurisdictions and economies. The value assigned to goodwill will not be deductible for tax purposes. The fair value of the identifiable intangible assets and related useful lives as included in the purchase price allocation as of December 31, 2019 include: \\xa0\\xa0Weighted Average Useful Lives\\xa0Estimated Fair Value\\xa0\\xa0(in years)\\xa0(in millions)Operation and maintenance agreements\\xa024\\xa0$12Customer relationships\\xa018\\xa0200Construction backlog \\xa01\\xa027Trade names\\xa010\\xa058Total \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$297Amortization expense related to the operation and maintenance agreements and construction backlog was $24\\xa0million in 2019, and is included in Non-utility cost of revenues, including natural gas on CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income. 134Amortization expense related to customer relationships and trade names was $16 million in 2019 and is included in Depreciation and amortization expense on CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income. The results of operations for Vectren included in CenterPoint Energy’s Consolidated Financial Statements from the Merger Date for the year ended December\\xa031, 2019 are as follows:\\xa0\\xa0(in millions)Operating revenues\\xa0$2,729Net income \\xa0190The following unaudited pro forma financial information reflects the consolidated results of operations of CenterPoint Energy, assuming the Merger had taken place on January 1, 2018.

Acquisition of Utility Pipeline Construction Company. An acquisition was made during the year ended December\\xa031, 2019 by CenterPoint Energy’s Infrastructure Services reportable segment, resulting in goodwill and intangible assets of approximately $6\\xa0million and $8 million, respectively.\\xa0The intangible assets primarily relate to backlog and customer relationships.\\xa0The allocation of the $25 million purchase price has been finalized. The results of operations for the acquired company have been included in CenterPoint Energy’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition and are not significant to the consolidated financial results of CenterPoint Energy. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented for the acquisition because the effects of the acquisition were not significant to CenterPoint Energy’s consolidated financial results for all periods presented.(5)   Revenue Recognition The Registrants adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and all related amendments on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method for those contracts that were not completed as of the date of adoption. Application of the new revenue standard did not result in a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. The adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on the Registrants’ financial position, results of operations or cash flows.In accordance with ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Registrants expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods or services. 135The following tables disaggregate revenues by reportable segment and major source:CenterPoint Energy\\xa0\\xa0Year Ended December 31, 2019\\xa0\\xa0Houston Electric T&D (1)\\xa0Indiana Electric Integrated (1) (4)\\xa0Natural Gas Distribution (1) (4)\\xa0Energy\\xa0Services (2)\\xa0Infrastructure Services (2) (4)\\xa0Corporate and Other (2) (4)\\xa0Total\\xa0\\xa0(in millions)Revenue from contracts\\xa0$2,984\\xa0$523\\xa0$3,680\\xa0$479\\xa0$1,190\\xa0$295\\xa0$9,151Derivatives income\\xa06\\xa0—\\xa02\\xa03,303\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa03,311Other (3)\\xa06\\xa0—\\xa01\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa05\\xa012Eliminations\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0(40)\\xa0(129)\\xa0(4)\\xa0—\\xa0(173)Total revenues\\xa0$2,996\\xa0$523\\xa0$3,643\\xa0$3,653\\xa0$1,186\\xa0$300\\xa0$12,301\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Year Ended December 31, 2018\\xa0\\xa0Houston Electric T&D (1)\\xa0Indiana Electric Integrated (1)\\xa0Natural Gas Distribution (1)\\xa0Energy\\xa0Services (2)\\xa0Infrastructure Services (2)\\xa0Corporate and Other (2)\\xa0Total\\xa0\\xa0(in millions)Revenue from contracts\\xa0$3,235\\xa0$—\\xa0$3,011\\xa0$493\\xa0$—\\xa0$6\\xa0$6,745Derivatives income\\xa0(2)\\xa0—\\xa0(2)\\xa04,028\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa04,024Other (3)\\xa0(1)\\xa0—\\xa0(42)\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa09\\xa0(34)Eliminations\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0(36)\\xa0(110)\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0(146)Total revenues\\xa0$3,232\\xa0$—\\xa0$2,931\\xa0$4,411\\xa0$—\\xa0$15\\xa0$10,589\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Year Ended December 31, 2017\\xa0\\xa0Houston Electric T&D (1)\\xa0Indiana Electric Integrated (1)\\xa0Natural Gas Distribution (1)\\xa0Energy Services (2)\\xa0Infrastructure Services (2)\\xa0Corporate and Other (2)\\xa0Total\\xa0\\xa0(in millions)Revenue from contracts\\xa0$3,001\\xa0$—\\xa0$2,638\\xa0$480\\xa0$—\\xa0$5\\xa0$6,124Derivatives income\\xa0(1)\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa03,569\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa03,568Other (3)\\xa0(3)\\xa0—\\xa01\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa09\\xa07Eliminations\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0(33)\\xa0(52)\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0(85)Total revenues\\xa0$2,997\\xa0$—\\xa0$2,606\\xa0$3,997\\xa0$—\\xa0$14\\xa0$9,614(1)Reflected in Utility revenues in the Statements of Consolidated Income.(2)Reflected in Non-utility revenues in the Statements of Consolidated Income.(3)Primarily consists of income from ARPs and leases.

The recognition of ARP revenues and the reversal of ARP revenues upon recovery through rates charged for utility service may not occur in the same period.CERC\\xa0\\xa0Year Ended December 31, 2019\\xa0\\xa0Natural Gas Distribution (1)\\xa0Energy\\xa0Services (2)\\xa0Corporate\\xa0and Other (2)\\xa0Total\\xa0\\xa0(in millions)Revenue from contracts\\xa0$2,945\\xa0$480\\xa0$5\\xa0$3,430Derivatives income\\xa02\\xa03,302\\xa0—\\xa03,304Other (3)\\xa04\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa04Eliminations\\xa0(40)\\xa0(128)\\xa0—\\xa0(168)Total revenues\\xa0$2,911\\xa0$3,654\\xa0$5\\xa0$6,570\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Year Ended December 31, 2018\\xa0\\xa0Natural Gas Distribution (1)\\xa0Energy\\xa0Services (2)\\xa0Corporate and Other (2)\\xa0Total\\xa0\\xa0(in millions)Revenue from contracts\\xa0$3,011\\xa0$493\\xa0$1\\xa0$3,505Derivatives income\\xa0(2)\\xa04,028\\xa0—\\xa04,026Other (3)\\xa0(42)\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0(42)Eliminations\\xa0(36)\\xa0(110)\\xa0—\\xa0(146)Total revenues\\xa0$2,931\\xa0$4,411\\xa0$1\\xa0$7,343\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Year Ended December 31, 2017\\xa0\\xa0Natural Gas Distribution (1)\\xa0Energy\\xa0Services (2)\\xa0Corporate and Other (2)\\xa0Total\\xa0\\xa0(in millions)Revenue from contracts\\xa0$2,638\\xa0$480\\xa0$—\\xa0$3,118Derivatives income\\xa0—\\xa03,569\\xa0—\\xa03,569Other (3)\\xa01\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa01Eliminations\\xa0(33)\\xa0(52)\\xa0—\\xa0(85)Total revenues\\xa0$2,606\\xa0$3,997\\xa0$—\\xa0$6,603(1)Reflected in Utility revenues in the Statements of Consolidated Income.(2)Reflected in Non-utility revenues in the Statements of Consolidated Income.(3)Primarily consists of income from ARPs and leases. ARPs are contracts between the utility and its regulators, not between the utility and a customer. The Registrants recognize ARP revenue as other revenues when the regulator-specified conditions for recognition have been met. Upon recovery of ARP revenue through incorporation in rates charged for utility service to customers, ARP revenue is reversed and recorded as revenue from contracts with customers. The recognition of ARP revenues and the reversal of ARP revenues upon recovery through rates charged for utility service may not occur in the same period.Revenues from Contracts with CustomersHouston Electric T&D (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric). Houston Electric distributes electricity to customers over time and customers consume the electricity when delivered. Revenue, consisting of both volumetric and fixed tariff rates set by the PUCT, is recognized as electricity is delivered and represents amounts both billed and unbilled. Discretionary services 137requested by customers are provided at a point in time with control transferring upon the completion of the service. Revenue for discretionary services is recognized upon completion of service based on the tariff rates set by the PUCT. Payments for electricity distribution and discretionary services are aggregated and received on a monthly basis. Houston Electric performs transmission services over time as a stand-ready obligation to provide a reliable network of transmission systems. Revenue is recognized upon time elapsed, and the monthly tariff rate set by the PUCT. Payments are received on a monthly basis.Indiana Electric Integrated (CenterPoint Energy). Indiana Electric generates, distributes and transmits electricity to customers over time, and customers consume the electricity when delivered. Revenue, consisting of both volumetric and fixed tariff rates set by state regulators, is recognized as electricity is delivered and represents amounts both billed and unbilled. Customers are billed monthly and payment terms, set by the regulator, require payment within a month of billing. Natural Gas Distribution (CenterPoint Energy and CERC).  CERC distributes and transports natural gas to customers over time, and customers consume the natural gas when delivered. Revenue, consisting of both volumetric and fixed tariff rates set by the state governing agency for that service area, is recognized as natural gas is delivered and represents amounts both billed and unbilled. Discretionary services requested by the customer are satisfied at a point in time and revenue is recognized upon completion of service and the tariff rates set by the applicable state regulator. Payments of natural gas distribution, transportation and discretionary services are aggregated and received on a monthly basis.Energy Services (CenterPoint Energy and CERC). The majority of CES natural gas sales contracts are considered a derivative, as the contracts typically have a stated minimum or contractual volume of delivery. For contracts in which CES delivers the full requirement of the natural gas needed by the customer and a volume is not stated, a contract as defined under ASC 606 is created upon the customer’s exercise of its option to take natural gas. CES supplies natural gas to retail customers over time as customers consume the natural gas when delivered. For wholesale customers, CES supplies natural gas at a point in time because the wholesale customer is presumed to have storage capabilities. Control is transferred to both types of customers upon delivery of natural gas. Revenue is recognized on a monthly basis based on the estimated volume of natural gas delivered and the price agreed upon with the customer. Payments are received on a monthly basis.AMAs are natural gas sales contracts under which CES also assumes management of a customer’s physical storage and/or transportation capacity. AMAs have two distinct performance obligations, which consist of natural gas sales and natural gas delivery because delivery could occur separate from the sale of natural gas (e.g., from storage to customer premises). Most AMAs’ natural gas sales performance obligations are accounted for as embedded derivatives. The transaction price is allocated between the sale of natural gas and the delivery based on the stand-alone selling price as stated in the contract. CES performs natural gas delivery over time as customers take delivery of the natural gas and recognizes revenue on an aggregated monthly basis based on the volume of natural gas delivered and the fees stated within the contract. Payments are received on a monthly basis.On February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. For further information, see Notes 6 and 23. Infrastructure Services (CenterPoint Energy). Infrastructure Services provides underground pipeline construction and repair services. The contracts are generally less than one year in duration and consist of fixed price, unit, and time and material customer contracts. Under unit or time and material contracts, Infrastructure Services performs construction and repair services under specific work-orders at prices established by master service agreements. The performance obligation is defined at the work-order level. These services are billed to customers monthly or more frequently for work completed based on units completed or the costs of time and material incurred and generally require payment within 30 days of billing. Infrastructure Services has the right to consideration from customers in an amount that corresponds directly with the performance obligation satisfied, and therefore recognizes revenue at a point in time in the amount to which it has the right to invoice, which results in accrued unbilled revenues at the end of each accounting period. Under fixed price contracts, Infrastructure Services performs larger scale construction and repair services. Each contract is typically accounted for as a single performance obligation. Services performed under fixed price contracts are typically billed per the terms of the contract, which can range from completion of specific milestones to scheduled billing intervals. Billings occur monthly or more frequently for work completed and generally require payment within 30 days of billing. Revenue for fixed price contracts is recognized over time as control is transferred using the input method, considering costs incurred relative to total expected cost. Total expected cost is therefore a significant judgment affecting the amount and timing of revenue recognition. Infrastructure Services’ revenues are not subject to significant returns, refunds or warranty obligations.138On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020.  For further information, see Notes 6 and 23.Contract Balances. When the timing of delivery of service is different from the timing of the payments made by customers and when the right to consideration is conditioned on something other than the passage of time, the Registrants recognize either a contract asset (performance precedes billing) or a contract liability (customer payment precedes performance). Those customers that prepay are represented by contract liabilities until the performance obligations are satisfied. The Registrants’ contract assets are included in Accrued unbilled revenues in their Consolidated Balance Sheets. On an aggregate basis as of December\\xa031, 2019, the Registrants’ contract assets primarily relate to contracts in the Infrastructure Services segment where revenue is recognized using the input method. The Registrants’ contract liabilities are included in Accounts payable and Other current liabilities in their Consolidated Balance Sheets. On an aggregate basis as of December\\xa031, 2019, the Registrants’ contract liabilities primarily relate to ESG contracts where revenue is recognized using the input method.The opening and closing balances of accounts receivable, other accrued unbilled revenue, contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers for the year ended December 31, 2019 are as follows: CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Accounts Receivable\\xa0Other Accrued Unbilled Revenues\\xa0ContractAssets\\xa0Contract Liabilities\\xa0(in millions)Opening balance as of December 31, 2018 (1)$516\\xa0$373\\xa0$—\\xa0$3Closing balance as of December 31, 2019800\\xa0579\\xa061\\xa034Increase$284\\xa0$206\\xa0$61\\xa0$31(1)Opening balances related to Vectren are as of February 1, 2019, and are thus excluded from the opening balance as of December 31, 2018.The amount of revenue recognized in the year ended December 31, 2019 that was included in the opening contract liability was $47 million. The difference between the opening and closing balances of the contract liabilities primarily results from the timing difference between CenterPoint Energy’s performance and the customer’s payment, plus the addition of obligations acquired in the Merger.Houston Electric\\xa0Accounts Receivable\\xa0Other Accrued Unbilled Revenues\\xa0Contract Liabilities\\xa0(in millions)Opening balance as of December 31, 2018 $234\\xa0$110\\xa0$3Closing balance as of December 31, 2019210\\xa0117\\xa03Increase (decrease)$(24)\\xa0$7\\xa0$—The amount of revenue recognized in the year ended December 31, 2019 that was included in the opening contract liability was $3 million.

The table below discloses (1) the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) as of the end of the reporting period for contracts and (2) when CenterPoint Energy expects to recognize this revenue. Such contracts include fixed price contracts and energy performance and sustainable infrastructure services contracts of ESG, which are included in Corporate and Other. \\xa0Rolling 12 Months\\xa0Thereafter\\xa0Total\\xa0(in millions)Revenue expected to be recognized on contracts in place as of December 31, 2019:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Infrastructure Services$254\\xa0$—\\xa0$254Corporate and Other84\\xa0752\\xa0836\\xa0$338\\xa0$752\\xa0$1,090Practical Expedients and Exemption.  Sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers are excluded from the transaction price. For contracts for which revenue from the satisfaction of the performance obligations is recognized in the amount invoiced, the practical expedient was elected and revenue expected to be recognized on these contracts has not been disclosed.(6)   Goodwill and Other Intangibles (CenterPoint Energy and CERC) CenterPoint Energy’s goodwill by reportable segment as of December\\xa031, 2018 and changes in the carrying amount of goodwill  as of December\\xa031, 2019 are as follows: \\xa0December 31, 2018\\xa0Additions (1)\\xa0Impairment\\xa0December\\xa031, 2019\\xa0(in millions)Indiana Electric Integrated$—\\xa0$1,121\\xa0$—\\xa0$1,121Natural Gas Distribution746\\xa02,566\\xa0—\\xa03,312Energy Services (2)110\\xa0—\\xa048\\xa062Infrastructure Services—\\xa0220\\xa0—\\xa0220Corporate and Other 11\\xa0438\\xa0—\\xa0449Total$867\\xa0$4,345\\xa0$48\\xa0$5,164(1)This represents the allocation of goodwill to reportable segments from the Merger, changes from preliminary amounts previously reported and includes the final determination of fair value for each reportable segment. See Note 4. (2)Amount presented is net of the accumulated goodwill impairment charge of $252 million recorded in 2012. As of December 31, 2019, CenterPoint Energy and CERC identified a triggering event to perform an interim goodwill impairment test and recognized a goodwill impairment on their Energy Services reporting unit which is included in Goodwill impairment on CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Consolidated Statements of Income.CERC’s goodwill by reportable segment as of December\\xa031, 2019 and December 31, 2018 is as follows:\\xa0December 31, 2018\\xa0Impairment\\xa0December 31, 2019\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(in millions)Natural Gas Distribution$746\\xa0$—\\xa0$746Energy Services (1)110\\xa048\\xa062Corporate and Other11\\xa0—\\xa011Total$867\\xa0$48\\xa0$819(1)Amount presented is net of the accumulated goodwill impairment charge of $252 million recorded in 2012.CenterPoint Energy and CERC perform goodwill impairment tests at least annually and evaluate goodwill when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment evaluation for goodwill is performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. The reporting units approximate the reportable segments, with the exception of ESG, which is a separate reporting unit but included 140in CenterPoint Energy’s Corporate and Other reportable segment. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is primarily determined based on an income approach or a weighted combination of income and market approaches. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit is in excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, then the excess amount is the impairment charge that should be recorded, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. See Note 2(g) for further discussion.CenterPoint Energy and CERC performed the annual goodwill impairment test on July 1 of each of 2019 and 2018\\xa0and determined that no goodwill impairment charge was required for any reporting unit in its annual test. In connection with its preparation of financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, CenterPoint Energy and CERC, as applicable, identified triggering events for interim goodwill impairment tests at the Infrastructure Services and Energy Services reporting units. Early stage bids received from market participants during the exploration of strategic alternatives for these businesses at year-end indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit was more likely than not below the carrying value.\\xa0 On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reporting unit. Per the Securities Purchase Agreement, VISCO will be converted from a wholly-owned corporation to a limited liability company that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes immediately prior to the closing of the transaction resulting in the sale of membership units at closing.\\xa0 The sale will be considered an asset sale for tax purposes requiring the net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $123 million within the reporting unit as of December 31, 2019 to be recognized as a benefit to deferred income tax expense by CenterPoint Energy upon closing; therefore, any deferred tax assets and liabilities within the reporting unit are not included in the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities that will be transferred to the buyer. For further information, see Note 23.On February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reporting unit. Per the Equity Purchase Agreement, CES will be converted from a wholly-owned corporation to a limited liability company that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes immediately prior to the closing of the transaction resulting in the sale of membership units at closing. For further information, see Note 23.The fair value of the Infrastructure Services reporting unit was estimated using a market approach deriving an estimated fair value as of December 31, 2019 based on the economic terms agreed upon within the Securities Purchase Agreement, a Level 2 fair value measurement.\\xa0 As of December 31, 2019 the fair value of the Infrastructure Services reporting unit exceeded the carrying value (inclusive of deferred income tax liabilities of $123 million) and no impairment loss was recognized. The fair value of the Energy Services reporting unit was estimated using a combination of the market approach and the income approach as of December 31, 2019, a Level 3 fair value measurement.  CenterPoint Energy and CERC utilized the economic indicators of value received by market participants during the exploration of strategic alternatives to inform the fair value of substantially all of the businesses within this reporting unit as of December 31, 2019.  Certain assets groups not constituting a business within the reporting unit were valued using an income approach.\\xa0 CenterPoint Energy and CERC recognized an impairment loss on their Energy Services reporting unit of $48 million, the amount by which the carrying value (inclusive of deferred income tax liabilities of $25 million) exceeded the fair value as of December 31, 2019.141The tables below present information on CenterPoint Energy’s other intangible assets recorded in Intangible assets, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the related amortization expense included in Depreciation and amortization on CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income, unless otherwise indicated. \\xa0\\xa0December\\xa031, 2019\\xa0December 31, 2018\\xa0\\xa0Gross Carrying Amount\\xa0Accumulated Amortization\\xa0Net Balance\\xa0Gross Carrying Amount\\xa0Accumulated Amortization\\xa0Net Balance\\xa0\\xa0(in millions)Customer relationships (1)\\xa0$286\\xa0$(43)\\xa0$243\\xa0$86\\xa0$(27)\\xa0$59Covenants not to compete\\xa04\\xa0(4)\\xa0—\\xa04\\xa0(3)\\xa01Trade names (1)\\xa058\\xa0(5)\\xa053\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0—Construction backlog (1) (2)\\xa027\\xa0(23)\\xa04\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0—Operation and maintenance\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0agreements (1) (2)\\xa012\\xa0(1)\\xa011\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0—Other (1)\\xa024\\xa0(14)\\xa010\\xa016\\xa0(11)\\xa05Total\\xa0$411\\xa0$(90)\\xa0$321\\xa0$106\\xa0$(41)\\xa0$65(1)The fair value of intangible assets acquired through acquisitions has been finalized.

The key proposals of the base rate case included:•a rate base of $6.4 billion with a 50% debt/50% equity capital structure and a 10.4% ROE;•a prudency determination on all capital investments made by Houston Electric since January 1, 2010;•the establishment of a rider to refund unprotected EDIT resulting from the TCJA; and•updated depreciation rates and approval to recover other costs.On September 16, 2019, the ALJs issued a PFD. The PUCT began deliberating on the PFD (which is prepared by ALJs at a different state agency) during its November 14, 2019 open meeting, but delayed final determination for further consideration. The PUCT again discussed the Houston Electric rate case at its December 13, 2019 open meeting and concluded that the PUCT would consider settlement a reasonable approach to resolving the rate case and noted that Houston Electric had indicated settlement negotiations were already underway. Houston Electric updated the PUCT at its January 16, 2020 open meeting regarding the status of settlement discussions, indicating that the parties were working on a settlement and anticipated a final settlement in the near future. On January 23, 2020, Houston Electric filed a Stipulation and Settlement Agreement with the PUCT, which provides for the following, among other things: •an overall revenue requirement increase of approximately $13 million; •an ROE of 9.4%; •a capital structure of 57.5% debt/42.5% equity; •a refund of unprotected EDIT of $105 million plus carrying costs over approximately 30-36 months; and•recovery of all retail transmission related costs through the TCRF. Also, Houston Electric is not required to make a one-time refund of capital recovery from its TCOS and DCRF mechanisms. Future TCOS filings will take into account both ADFIT and EDIT until the final order from Houston Electric’s next base rate proceeding. No rate base items are expected to be written off; however, approximately $12 million in rate case expenses were written off in 2019. A base rate case application must be filed for Houston Electric no later than four years from the date of the PUCT’s final order in the proceeding. Additionally, Houston Electric will not file a DCRF in 2020, nor will a subsequent separate proceeding with the PUCT be instituted regarding EDIT on Houston Electric’s securitized assets.   Furthermore, under the terms of the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement, Houston Electric agreed to adopt certain ring-fencing measures to increase its financial separateness from CenterPoint Energy, which include the following:  •Houston Electric’s credit agreements and indentures shall not contain cross-default provisions by which a default by CenterPoint Energy or its other affiliates would cause a default at Houston Electric;•The financial covenant in Houston Electric’s credit agreement shall not be related to any entity other than Houston Electric.  Houston Electric shall not include in its debt or credit agreements any financial covenants or rating agency triggers related to any entity other than Houston Electric; •Houston Electric shall not pledge its assets in respect of or guarantee any debt or obligation of any of its affiliates. Houston Electric shall not pledge, mortgage, hypothecate, or grant a lien upon the property of Houston Electric except pursuant to an exception in effect in Houston Electric’s current credit agreement, such as Houston Electric’s first mortgage and general mortgage; 145•Houston Electric shall maintain its own stand-alone credit facility, and Houston Electric shall not share its credit facility with any regulated or unregulated affiliate; •Houston Electric shall maintain ratings with all three major credit ratings agencies; •Houston Electric shall maintain a stand-alone credit rating; •Houston Electric’s first mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds shall be secured only with assets of Houston Electric;\\xa0•No Houston Electric assets may be used to secure the debt of CenterPoint Energy or its other affiliates; •Houston Electric shall not hold out its credit as being available to pay the debt of any affiliates (provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, Houston Electric is not considered to be holding its credit out to pay the debt of affiliates, or in breach of any other ring-fencing measure, with respect to the $68 million of Houston Electric general mortgage bonds that currently serve as collateral for certain outstanding CenterPoint Energy pollution control bonds); •Without prior approval of the PUCT, neither CenterPoint Energy nor any affiliate of CenterPoint Energy (excluding Houston Electric) may incur, guarantee, or pledge assets in respect of any incremental new debt that is dependent on: (1) the revenues of Houston Electric in more than a proportionate degree than the other revenues of CenterPoint Energy; or (2) the equity of Houston Electric; •Houston Electric shall not transfer any material assets or facilities to any affiliates, other than a transfer that is on an arm’s length basis consistent with the PUCT’s affiliate standards applicable to Houston Electric; •Except for its participation in an affiliate money pool, Houston Electric shall not commingle its assets with those of other CenterPoint Energy affiliates;•Except for its participation in an affiliate money pool, Houston Electric shall not lend money to or borrow money from CenterPoint Energy; and•Houston Electric shall notify the PUCT if its issuer credit rating or corporate credit rating as rated by any of the three major rating agencies falls below investment grade.\\xa0The PUCT approved the settlement at its February 14, 2020 open meeting.  A final order from the PUCT is currently expected during the first quarter of 2020; however, motions for rehearing, if granted, could result in the order being issued after the first quarter of 2020. The rates are expected to be implemented 45 days after the final order is issued. CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric record pre-tax expense for (i) probable disallowances of  capital investments and (ii) customer refund obligations and costs deferred in regulatory assets when recovery of such amounts is no longer considered probable. (8)   Stock-Based Incentive Compensation Plans and Employee Benefit Plans(a) Stock-Based Incentive Compensation Plans (CenterPoint Energy)CenterPoint Energy has LTIPs that provide for the issuance of stock-based incentives, including stock options, performance awards, restricted stock unit awards and restricted and unrestricted stock awards to officers, employees and non-employee directors.\\xa0 Approximately 14 million shares of Common Stock are authorized under these plans for awards. CenterPoint Energy issues new shares of its Common Stock to satisfy stock-based payments related to LTIPs. Equity awards are granted to employees without cost to the participants.Compensation costs for the performance and stock unit awards granted under LTIPs are measured using fair value and expected achievement levels on the grant date.\\xa0For performance awards with operational goals, the achievement levels are revised as goals are evaluated.  The fair value of awards granted to employees is based on the closing stock price of CenterPoint Energy’s Common Stock on the grant date.\\xa0The compensation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.\\xa0\\xa0Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant based on historical averages and estimates are updated periodically throughout the vesting period.\\xa0\\xa0146 The performance awards granted in 2019, 2018 and 2017 are distributed based upon the achievement of certain objectives over a three-year performance cycle. The stock unit awards granted in 2019, 2018 and 2017 are service based. The stock unit awards generally vest at the end of a three-year period, provided, however, that stock unit awards granted to non-employee directors vested at the end of a one-year period (for awards granted in 2017) or vested immediately upon grant (for awards granted in 2019 and 2018). Upon vesting, both the performance and stock unit awards are issued to the participants along with the value of dividend equivalents earned over the performance cycle or vesting period. The following table summarizes CenterPoint Energy’s expenses related to LTIPs for 2019, 2018 and 2017:\\xa0Year Ended December 31,\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017\\xa0(in millions)LTIP Compensation expense (1)$28\\xa0$26\\xa0$21Income tax benefit recognized7\\xa06\\xa08Actual tax benefit realized for tax deductions12\\xa05\\xa06(1)Amounts presented in the table above are included in Operation and maintenance expense in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income and shown prior to any amounts capitalized.\\xa0The following tables summarize CenterPoint Energy’s LTIP activity for 2019:  \\xa0Year Ended December 31, 2019\\xa0Shares(Thousands)\\xa0Weighted-AverageGrant DateFair Value\\xa0Remaining AverageContractualLife (Years)\\xa0AggregateIntrinsicValue (2)\\xa0(Millions)Performance Awards\\xa0(1)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Outstanding and non-vested as of December 31, 20183,818\\xa0$23.91\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Granted1,413\\xa031.16\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Forfeited or canceled(825)\\xa024.78\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Vested and released to participants(1,074)\\xa018.97\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Outstanding and non-vested as of December 31, 20193,332\\xa0$28.36\\xa01.1\\xa0$53\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Stock Unit Awards\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Outstanding and non-vested as of December 31, 20181,060\\xa0$24.08\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Granted470\\xa031.07\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Forfeited or canceled(131)\\xa027.95\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Vested and released to participants(433)\\xa020.72\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Outstanding and non-vested as of December 31, 2019966\\xa0$28.46\\xa01.2\\xa0$26\\xa0(1)Reflects maximum performance achievement.(2)Reflects the impact of current expectations of achievement and stock price.147The weighted average grant date fair values per unit of awards granted were as follows for 2019, 2018 and 2017:\\xa0Year Ended December 31,\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017\\xa0(In millions, except for per unit amounts)Performance Awards\\xa0Weighted-average grant date fair value per unit of awards granted$31.16\\xa0$26.74\\xa0$26.64Total intrinsic value of awards received by participants36\\xa012\\xa07Vested grant date fair value20\\xa09\\xa05\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Stock Unit Awards\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Weighted-average grant date fair value per unit of awards granted$31.07\\xa0$26.62\\xa0$26.77Total intrinsic value of awards received by participants15\\xa09\\xa09Vested grant date fair value9\\xa07\\xa07\\xa0As of December\\xa031, 2019, there was $34 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested performance and stock awards which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years.(b) Pension Benefits (CenterPoint Energy)CenterPoint Energy maintains a non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covering eligible employees, with benefits determined using a cash balance formula. In addition to the non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan, CenterPoint Energy maintains unfunded non-qualified benefit restoration plans which allow participants to receive the benefits to which they would have been entitled under CenterPoint Energy’s non-contributory qualified pension plan except for federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated.As a result of the Merger, CenterPoint Energy now also maintains three additional qualified defined benefit pension plans which are closed to new participants and a non-qualified supplemental retirement plan. The defined benefit pension plans cover eligible full-time regular employees and retirees of Vectren and are primarily non-contributory.CenterPoint Energy’s net periodic cost includes the following components relating to pension, including the non-qualified benefit plans:\\xa0Year Ended December\\xa031,\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017\\xa0(in millions)Service cost (1)$40\\xa0$37\\xa0$36Interest cost (2)96\\xa079\\xa089Expected return on plan assets (2)(105)\\xa0(107)\\xa0(97)Amortization of prior service cost (2)9\\xa09\\xa09Amortization of net loss (2)52\\xa043\\xa058Settlement cost (2) (3)2\\xa0—\\xa0—Curtailment gain (2) (4)(1)\\xa0—\\xa0—Net periodic cost$93\\xa0$61\\xa0$95\\xa0(1)Amounts presented in the table above are included in Operation and maintenance expense in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income, net of regulatory deferrals and amounts capitalized.(2)Amounts presented in the table above are included in Other, net in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income, net of regulatory deferrals.(3)A one-time, non-cash settlement cost is required when the total lump sum distributions or other settlements of plan benefit obligations during a plan year exceed the service cost and interest cost components of the net periodic cost for that year.  In 2019, CenterPoint Energy recognized a non-cash settlement cost due to lump sum settlement payments.148(4)A curtailment gain or loss is required when the expected future services of a significant number of employees are reduced or eliminated for the accrual of benefits. In 2019, CenterPoint Energy recognized a pension curtailment gain related to employees who were terminated after the Merger closed. CenterPoint Energy used the following assumptions to determine net periodic cost relating to pension benefits:\\xa0Year Ended December\\xa031,\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017Discount rate4.35%\\xa03.65%\\xa04.15%Expected return on plan assets6.00\\xa06.00\\xa06.00Rate of increase in compensation levels4.60\\xa04.45\\xa04.50In determining net periodic benefit cost, CenterPoint Energy uses fair value, as of the beginning of the year, as its basis for determining expected return on plan assets.The following table summarizes changes in the benefit obligation, plan assets, the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as well as the key assumptions of CenterPoint Energy’s pension plans. The measurement dates for plan assets and obligations were December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018.\\xa0December\\xa031,\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa0(in millions, except for actuarial assumptions)Change in Benefit Obligation\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Benefit obligation, beginning of year$2,013\\xa0$2,225Plan obligations assumed in Merger332\\xa0—Service cost40\\xa037Interest cost96\\xa079Benefits paid(244)\\xa0(201)Actuarial (gain) loss (1)216\\xa0(127)Plan amendment1\\xa0—Curtailment(1)\\xa0—Benefit obligation, end of year2,453\\xa02,013Change in Plan Assets\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Fair value of plan assets, beginning of year1,516\\xa01,801Plan assets assumed in Merger286\\xa0—Employer contributions109\\xa069Benefits paid(244)\\xa0(201)Actual investment return 338\\xa0(153)Fair value of plan assets, end of year2,005\\xa01,516Funded status, end of year$(448)\\xa0$(497)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Amounts Recognized in Balance Sheets\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Current liabilities-other$(8)\\xa0$(7)Other liabilities-benefit obligations(440)\\xa0(490)Net liability, end of year$(448)\\xa0$(497)Actuarial Assumptions\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Discount rate (2)3.20%\\xa04.35%Expected return on plan assets (3)5.75\\xa06.00Rate of increase in compensation levels4.95\\xa04.60Interest crediting rate3.25\\xa03.75149(1)Significant sources of loss for 2019 include the decrease in discount rate from 4.35% to 3.20%. Significant sources of gain for 2018 include the increase in discount rate from 3.65% to 4.35% and the mortality projection scale change from MP2017 to MP2018.(2)The discount rate assumption was determined by matching the projected cash flows of CenterPoint Energy’s plans against a hypothetical yield curve of high-quality corporate bonds represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates from one-half to 99 years. (3)The expected rate of return assumption was developed using the targeted asset allocation of CenterPoint Energy’s plans and the expected return for each asset class. The following table displays pension benefits related to CenterPoint Energy’s pension plans that have accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets: \\xa0December\\xa031,\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa0Pension(Qualified)\\xa0Pension(Non-qualified)\\xa0Pension(Qualified)\\xa0Pension(Non-qualified)\\xa0(in millions)Accumulated benefit obligation$2,352\\xa0$68\\xa0$1,930\\xa0$61Projected benefit obligation2,385\\xa068\\xa01,952\\xa061Fair value of plan assets2,005\\xa0—\\xa01,516\\xa0—The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans on CenterPoint Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets was $2,420 million and $1,991 million as of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, respectively.Multi-employer Pension PlanCenterPoint Energy, through its Infrastructure Services reportable segment, participates in several industry wide multi-employer pension plans for its collective bargaining employees which provide for monthly benefits based on length of service. The risks of participating in multi-employer pension plans are different from the risks of participating in single-employer pension plans in the following respects: (1) assets contributed to the multi-employer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers, (2) if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan allocable to such withdrawing employer may be borne by the remaining participating employers and (3) if CenterPoint Energy stops participation in some of its multi-employer pension plans, CenterPoint Energy may be required to pay those plans an amount based on its allocable share of the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.Expense is recognized as payments are accrued for work performed or when withdrawal liabilities are probable and estimable. Expense associated with multi-employer plans of $52 million during the year ended December\\xa031, 2019. During 2019, CenterPoint Energy made contributions to these multi-employer plans on behalf of employees that participate in approximately 215 local unions. Contracts with these unions are negotiated with trade agreements through two primary contractor associations. These trade agreements have varying expiration dates ranging from 2020 through 2022. The average contribution related to these local unions was less than $1 million, and the largest contribution was approximately $5 million. Multiple unions can contribute to a single multi-employer plan. CenterPoint Energy made contributions to at least 72 plans in 2019, eight of which are considered significant plans based on, among other things, the amount of the contributions, the number of employees participating in the plan, and the funded status of the plan.CenterPoint Energy’s participation in the significant plans is outlined in the following table. The EIN / Pension Plan Number column provides the EIN and three-digit pension plan numbers. The most recent Pension Protection Act Zone Status available in 2019 is for the plan year end at January 31, 2019 for the Central Pension Fund, May 31, 2019 for the Indiana Pension Laborers Fund, December 31, 2018 for the Pipeline Industry Benefit Fund, December 31, 2018 for the Laborers District Council & Contractors’ Pension Fund of Ohio, April 30, 2019 for the Ohio Operating Engineers Pension Fund, April 30, 2019 for the Operating Engineers Local 324 Fringe Benefit Fund, December 31, 2018 for the Minnesota Laborers Pension Fund, and December 31, 2018 for the Laborers’ Combined Fund of Western Pennsylvania. Generally, plans in the red zone are less than 65% funded, plans in the yellow zone are less than 80% funded and plans in the green zone are at least 80% funded. The FIP/RP Status Pending / Implemented column indicates plans for which a FIP or RP is either pending or has been implemented. The multi-employer contributions listed in the table below are CenterPoint Energy’s multi-employer contributions made in 2019.Federal law requires pension plans in endangered status to adopt a FIP and plans in critical status to adopt a RP aimed at 150restoring the financial health of the plan. In December 2014, the Multi-employer Pension Reform Act of 2014 was passed and permanently extended the Pension Protection Act of 2006 multi-employer plan critical and endangered status funding rules, among other things, including providing a provision for a plan sponsor to suspend or reduce benefit payments to preserve plans in critical and declining status.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Pension Protection Act Zone Status\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Multi-employer Contributions\\xa0\\xa0Pension Fund\\xa0EIN/PensionPlan Number\\xa02019\\xa0FIP/RP Status Pending/Implemented\\xa02019\\xa0Surcharge Imposed\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(in millions)\\xa0\\xa0Central Pension Fund\\xa036-6052390-001\\xa0Green\\xa0No\\xa0$12\\xa0NoIndiana Laborers Pension Fund\\xa035-6027150-001\\xa0Green\\xa0No\\xa05\\xa0NoPipeline Industry Benefit Fund\\xa073-0742835-001\\xa0Green\\xa0No\\xa05\\xa0NoLaborers District Fund of Ohio\\xa031-6129964-001\\xa0Green\\xa0No\\xa04\\xa0NoOhio Operating Engineers Pension Fund\\xa031-6129968-001\\xa0Green\\xa0No\\xa03\\xa0NoOperating Engineers Local #324 Fund (1)\\xa038-1900637-001\\xa0Red\\xa0Implemented\\xa03\\xa0NoMinnesota Laborers Pension Fund\\xa041-6159599-001\\xa0Green\\xa0No\\xa03\\xa0NoLaborers’ Combined Fund of Western PA (2)\\xa025-6135576-001\\xa0Red\\xa0Implemented\\xa02\\xa0NoOther\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa015\\xa0\\xa0Total Contributions\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$52\\xa0\\xa0(1)The Operating Engineers Local #324 Fringe Benefits Fund was certified to be in “critical” status for the plan year ending April 30, 2019. In an effort to improve the plan’s funding situation, on March 17, 2011, the trustees adopted a plan amendment, which reduced benefit accruals and eliminated some ancillary benefits, and adopted an RP that will be effective from May 1, 2013 through April 30, 2023 or until the plan is no longer in critical status. On April 27, 2015, the trustees updated the RP to change the annual standard for meeting the requirements of the RP. The trustees further updated the RP on January 29, 2019. The annual standard is that actuarial projections updated for each year show the fund is expected to remain solvent for a 20-year projection period.(2)The Laborers’ Combined Fund of Western Pennsylvania was previously deemed in critical status. The trustees adopted a FIP that is scheduled to run through December 31, 2020 and provided for changes in adjustable benefits and increases in the employer contribution rate.While not considered significant to CenterPoint Energy, there are four plans in red zone status receiving CenterPoint Energy contributions. There are also five other plans where CenterPoint Energy contributions exceed 5% of each plan’s total contributions; however, none of these plans are considered significant to CenterPoint Energy.On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020.  For further information, see Notes 6 and 23. As a result, CenterPoint Energy will no longer participate in the multi-employer pension plans discussed above.\\xa0(c) Postretirement BenefitsCenterPoint Energy provides certain healthcare and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees on both a contributory and non-contributory basis. The Registrants’ employees (other than employees of Vectren and its subsidiaries) who were hired before January 1, 2018 and who have met certain age and service requirements at retirement, as defined in the plans, are eligible to participate in these benefit plans. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2018 are not eligible for these benefits, except that such employees represented by IBEW Local Union 66 are eligible to participate in certain of the benefits, subject to the applicable age and service requirements. With respect to retiree medical and prescription drug benefits, employees represented by the IBEW Local Union 66 who retire on or after January 1, 2017, and their dependents, receive any such benefits exclusively through the NECA/IBEW Family Medical Care Plan pursuant to the terms of the renegotiated collective bargaining agreement entered into in May 2016. Houston Electric and CERC are required to fund a portion of their obligations in accordance with rate orders. All other obligations are funded on a pay-as-you-go basis.151As a result of the Merger, CenterPoint Energy now maintains an additional postretirement benefit plan. The postretirement benefit plan provides health care and life insurance benefits, which are a combination of self-insured and fully insured programs, to eligible Vectren retirees on both a contributory and non-contributory basis.Postretirement benefits are accrued over the active service period of employees. The net postretirement benefit cost includes the following components:\\xa0Year Ended December\\xa031,\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0(in millions)Service cost (1)$3\\xa0$1\\xa0$1\\xa0$2\\xa0$—\\xa0$1\\xa0$2\\xa0$1\\xa0$1Interest cost (2)15\\xa07\\xa05\\xa013\\xa08\\xa04\\xa016\\xa09\\xa05Expected return on plan assets (2)(5)\\xa0(4)\\xa0(1)\\xa0(5)\\xa0(4)\\xa0(1)\\xa0(5)\\xa0(4)\\xa0(1)Amortization of prior service cost (credit) (2)(5)\\xa0(6)\\xa01\\xa0(5)\\xa0(5)\\xa01\\xa0(5)\\xa0(6)\\xa01Net postretirement benefit cost (credit)$8\\xa0$(2)\\xa0$6\\xa0$5\\xa0$(1)\\xa0$5\\xa0$8\\xa0$—\\xa0$6(1)Amounts presented in the table above are included in Operation and maintenance expense in each of the Registrants’ respective Statements of Consolidated Income, net of regulatory deferrals and amounts capitalized.(2)Amounts presented in the table above are included in Other, net in each of the Registrants’ respective Statements of Consolidated Income, net of regulatory deferrals.The following assumptions were used to determine net periodic cost relating to postretirement benefits:\\xa0Year Ended December\\xa031,\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERCDiscount rate3.20%\\xa03.20%\\xa03.20%\\xa03.60%\\xa03.60%\\xa03.60%\\xa04.15%\\xa04.15%\\xa04.15%Expected return on plan assets4.60\\xa04.70\\xa04.15\\xa04.55\\xa04.75\\xa03.85\\xa04.50\\xa04.75\\xa03.60152The following table summarizes changes in the benefit obligation, plan assets, the amounts recognized in consolidated balance sheets and the key assumptions of the postretirement plans.

Under the plan, participating employees may make pre-tax or Roth contributions and, if eligible, after-tax contributions up to certain federally mandated limits. Participating Registrants provide matching contributions and, as of January 1, 2020, nonelective contributions, if eligible, up to certain limits. CenterPoint Energy, through the Merger, also acquired additional defined contribution retirement savings plans sponsored by Vectren and its subsidiaries that are qualified under sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code, one of which merged into the CenterPoint Energy Savings Plan as of January 1, 2020.  The CenterPoint Energy Savings Plan has significant holdings of Common Stock. As of December\\xa031, 2019, 11,051,800 shares of Common Stock were held by the savings plan, which represented approximately 13% of its investments. Given the concentration of the investments in Common Stock, the savings plan and its participants have market risk related to this investment. The savings plan limits the percentage of future contributions that can be invested in Common Stock to 25% and prohibits transfers of account balances where the transfer would result in more than 25% of a participant’s total account balance invested in Common Stock.CenterPoint Energy allocates the savings plan benefit expense to Houston Electric and CERC related to their respective employees. The following table summarizes the Registrants’ savings plan benefit expense for 2019, 2018 and 2017:\\xa0Year Ended December\\xa031,\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0(in millions)\\xa0\\xa0Savings plan benefit\\xa0expenses (1)$58\\xa0$18\\xa0$18\\xa0$43\\xa0$17\\xa0$18\\xa0$41\\xa0$17\\xa0$17(1)Amounts presented in the table above are included in Operation and maintenance expense in the Registrants’ respective  Statements of Consolidated Income and shown prior to any amounts capitalized.(i) Other Benefits PlansThe Registrants participate in CenterPoint Energy’s plans that provide postemployment benefits for certain former or inactive employees, their beneficiaries and covered dependents, after employment but before retirement (primarily healthcare and life insurance benefits for participants in the long-term disability plan). CenterPoint Energy maintains non-qualified deferred compensation plans, including plans acquired in the Merger, that provide benefits payable to eligible directors, officers and select employees or their designated beneficiaries at specified future dates or upon termination, retirement or death. Benefit payments are made from the general assets of the participating Registrants. 157Expenses related to other benefit plans were recorded as follows:\\xa0Year Ended December\\xa031,\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0(in millions)\\xa0\\xa0Postemployment benefits$2\\xa0$1\\xa0$1\\xa0$3\\xa0$4\\xa0$1\\xa0$6\\xa0$1\\xa0$4Deferred compensation plans4\\xa01\\xa0—\\xa03\\xa01\\xa0—\\xa03\\xa01\\xa0—Amounts related to other benefit plans were included in Benefit Obligations in the Registrants’ accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:\\xa0December\\xa031, 2019\\xa0December\\xa031, 2018\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0(in millions)Postemployment benefits$11\\xa0$3\\xa0$7\\xa0$11\\xa0$3\\xa0$7Deferred compensation plans41\\xa08\\xa03\\xa042\\xa09\\xa03Split-dollar life insurance arrangements 32\\xa01\\xa0—\\xa036\\xa01\\xa0—(j) Change in Control Agreements and Other Employee MattersCenterPoint Energy has a change in control plan, which was amended and restated on May 1, 2017.\\xa0The plan generally provides, to the extent applicable, in the case of a change in control of CenterPoint Energy and covered termination of employment, for severance benefits of up to three times annual base salary plus bonus, and other benefits.\\xa0Certain CenterPoint Energy officers, including the Executive Chairman, are participants under the plan.Certain key employees of Vectren and its subsidiaries have change in control agreements or employment agreements that provide payments and other benefits upon a covered termination of employment.

In addition, these subsidiaries have various project agreements and small local agreements.\\xa0\\xa0These agreements expire upon completion of a specific project or on various dates throughout the year.158(9)  Derivative Instruments The Registrants are exposed to various market risks. These risks arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business.\\xa0The Registrants utilize derivative instruments such as physical forward contracts, swaps and options to mitigate the impact of changes in commodity prices, weather and interest rates on operating results and cash flows. (a) Non-Trading ActivitiesCommodity Derivative Instruments (CenterPoint Energy and CERC). CenterPoint Energy, through its Indiana utilities, and CERC, through CES, enter into certain derivative instruments to mitigate the effects of commodity price movements.\\xa0Certain financial instruments used to hedge portions of the natural gas inventory of the Energy Services reportable segment are designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes. Outstanding derivative instruments designated as economic hedges at the Indiana Utilities hedge long-term variable rate natural gas purchases.\\xa0The Indiana Utilities have authority to refund and recover mark-to-market gains and losses associated with hedging natural gas purchases, and thus the gains and losses on derivatives are deferred in a regulatory liability or asset.\\xa0All other financial instruments do not qualify or are not designated as cash flow or fair value hedges.On February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. For further information, see Notes 6 and 23. Interest Rate Risk Derivative Instruments. From time to time, the Registrants may enter into interest rate derivatives that are designated as economic or cash flow hedges. The objective of these hedges is to offset risk associated with interest rates borne by the Registrants in connection with an anticipated future fixed rate debt offering or other exposure to variable rate debt. The Indiana Utilities have authority to refund and recover mark-to-market gains and losses associated with hedging financing activity, and thus the gains and losses on derivatives are deferred in a regulatory liability or asset. For the impacts of cash flow hedges to Accumulated other comprehensive income, see Note 13.

CenterPoint Energy and CERC have weather normalization or other rate mechanisms that largely mitigate the impact of weather on NGD in Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Minnesota, Ohio and Oklahoma, as applicable. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD in Texas and CenterPoint Energy’s electric operations in Texas and Indiana do not have such mechanisms, although fixed customer charges are historically higher in Texas for NGD compared to its other jurisdictions. As a result, fluctuations from normal weather may have a positive or negative effect on CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD’s results in Texas and on CenterPoint Energy’s electric operations’ results in its Texas and Indiana service territories.CenterPoint Energy and CERC, as applicable, enter into winter season weather hedges from time to time for certain NGD jurisdictions and electric operations’ service territory to mitigate the effect of fluctuations from normal weather on results of operations and cash flows. These weather hedges are based on heating degree days at 10-year normal weather. Houston Electric and Indiana Electric do not enter into weather hedges. 159The tables below summarizes CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s weather hedge gain (loss) activity:CenterPoint Energy\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Year Ended December 31,Texas Operations\\xa0Winter Season\\xa0Bilateral Cap\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(in millions)NGD\\xa02019 – 2020\\xa0$8\\xa0$2\\xa0$—\\xa0$—NGD\\xa02018 – 2019\\xa09\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0—NGD\\xa02017 – 2018\\xa08\\xa0—\\xa0(2)\\xa0—Electric operations\\xa02019 – 2020\\xa07\\xa03\\xa0—\\xa0—Electric operations\\xa02018 – 2019\\xa08\\xa03\\xa0—\\xa0—Electric operations\\xa02017 – 2018\\xa09\\xa0—\\xa0(2)\\xa0—Electric operations\\xa02016 – 2017\\xa09\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0(1)Total CenterPoint Energy (1)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$8\\xa0$(4)\\xa0$(1)CERC\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Year Ended December 31,Texas Operations\\xa0Winter Season\\xa0Bilateral Cap\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(in millions)NGD\\xa02019 – 2020\\xa0$8\\xa0$2\\xa0$—\\xa0$—NGD\\xa02018 – 2019\\xa09\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0—NGD\\xa02017 – 2018\\xa08\\xa0—\\xa0(2)\\xa0—Total CERC (1)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$2\\xa0$(2)\\xa0$—(1)Weather hedge gains (losses) are recorded in Revenues in the Statements of Consolidated Income.160(b) Derivative Fair Values and Income Statement ImpactsThe following tables present information about derivative instruments and hedging activities.

For unrated counterparties, CERC determines a synthetic credit rating by performing financial statement analysis and consider contractual rights and restrictions and collateral.165(2)End users are comprised primarily of customers who have contracted to fix the price of a portion of their physical gas requirements for future periods.(3)The amounts reflected in the table above were not impacted by collateral netting.(10)  Fair Value Measurements Assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value in the Registrants’ Consolidated Balance Sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their value. Hierarchical levels, as defined below and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuations of these assets and liabilities, are as follows:Level 1: Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.\\xa0The types of assets carried at Level 1 fair value generally are exchange-traded derivatives and equity securities, as well as natural gas inventory that has been designated as the hedged item in a fair value hedge.Level 2: Inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability.\\xa0Fair value assets and liabilities that are generally included in this category are derivatives with fair values based on inputs from actively quoted markets.\\xa0A market approach is utilized to value the Registrants’ Level 2 natural gas derivative assets or liabilities. CenterPoint Energy’s Level 2 indexed debt securities derivative is valued using an option model and a discounted cash flow model, which uses projected dividends on the ZENS-Related Securities and a discount rate as observable inputs.Level 3: Inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs reflect the Registrants’ judgments about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability since limited market data exists. The Registrants develop these inputs based on the best information available, including the Registrants’ own data. A market approach is utilized to value the Registrants’ Level 3 assets or liabilities. As of December\\xa031, 2019, CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Level 3 assets and liabilities are comprised of physical natural gas forward contracts and options.  Level 3 physical natural gas forward contracts and options are valued using a discounted cash flow model which includes illiquid forward price curve locations (ranging from $1.44 to $5.20 per MMBtu for CenterPoint Energy and from $1.44 to $5.20 per MMBtu for CERC) as an unobservable input. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Level 3 physical natural gas forward contracts and options derivative assets and liabilities consist of both long and short positions (forwards and options). Forward price decreases (increases) as of December\\xa031, 2019 would have resulted in lower (higher) values, respectively, for long forwards and options and higher (lower) values, respectively, for short forwards and options.The Registrants determine the appropriate level for each financial asset and liability on a quarterly basis and recognize transfers between levels at the end of the reporting period.\\xa0\\xa0The following tables present information about the Registrants’ assets and liabilities (including derivatives that are presented net) measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December\\xa031, 2019 and December\\xa031, 2018, and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Registrants to determine such fair value.CenterPoint

amounts related to physical forward transactions with Enable. 167(4)Level 1 natural gas derivatives include exchange-traded derivatives cleared by the CME, which deems that financial instruments cleared by the CME are settled daily in connection with posted cash payments.  As a result of this exchange rule, CME-related derivatives are considered to have no fair value at the balance sheet date for financial reporting purposes, and are presented in Level 1 net of posted cash; however, the derivatives remain outstanding and subject to future commodity price fluctuations until they are settled in accordance with their contractual terms. Derivative transactions cleared on exchanges other than the CME (e.g., the Intercontinental Exchange or ICE) continue to be reported on a gross basis.The following table presents additional information about assets or liabilities, including derivatives that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis for which CenterPoint Energy and CERC have utilized Level 3 inputs to determine fair value:\\xa0Year Ended December\\xa031,\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0CERC\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0CERC\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0CERC\\xa0(in millions)Beginning balance$30\\xa0$30\\xa0$(622)\\xa0$46\\xa0$(704)\\xa0$13Total gains 17\\xa017\\xa030\\xa030\\xa096\\xa047Total settlements (22)\\xa0(22)\\xa0(39)\\xa0(39)\\xa0(11)\\xa0(11)Transfers into Level 3(1)\\xa0(1)\\xa05\\xa05\\xa014\\xa014Transfers out of Level 3 (1)(6)\\xa0(6)\\xa0656\\xa0(12)\\xa0(17)\\xa0(17)Ending balance (2)$18\\xa0$18\\xa0$30\\xa0$30\\xa0$(622)\\xa0$46\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The amount of total gains for the period included in earnings attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to assets still held at the reporting date: \\xa0$12\\xa0$12\\xa0$18\\xa0$18\\xa0$87\\xa0$38(1)During 2018, CenterPoint Energy transferred its indexed debt securities derivative from Level 3 to Level 2 to reflect changes in the significance of the unobservable inputs used in the valuation.(2)CenterPoint Energy and CERC did not have significant Level 3 purchases or sales during any of the years ended December\\xa031, 2019, 2018 or 2017.Estimated Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe fair values of cash and cash equivalents, investments in debt and equity securities classified as “trading” and short-term borrowings are estimated to be approximately equivalent to carrying amounts and have been excluded from the table below. The carrying amounts of non-trading derivative assets and liabilities and CenterPoint Energy’s ZENS indexed debt securities derivative are stated at fair value and are excluded from the table below.\\xa0The fair value of each debt instrument is determined by multiplying the principal amount of each debt instrument by a combination of historical trading prices and comparable issue data. These liabilities, which are not measured at fair value in the Registrants’ Consolidated Balance Sheets, but for which the fair value is disclosed, would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\\xa0December\\xa031, 2019\\xa0December\\xa031, 2018\\xa0CenterPoint Energy (1)\\xa0Houston Electric (1)\\xa0CERC\\xa0CenterPoint Energy (1)\\xa0Houston Electric (1)\\xa0CERCLong-term debt, including current maturities(in millions)Carrying amount$15,093\\xa0$4,950\\xa0$2,546\\xa0$9,140\\xa0$4,717\\xa0$2,371Fair value16,067\\xa05,457\\xa02,803\\xa09,308\\xa04,770\\xa02,488(1)Includes Securitization Bond debt.Items measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring BasisCenterPoint Energy and CERC recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $48 million related to its Energy Services reporting unit in 2019. See Note 6. 168(11)   Unconsolidated Affiliates (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)   CenterPoint Energy has the ability to significantly influence the operating and financial policies of Enable, a publicly traded MLP, and, accordingly, accounts for its investment in Enable’s common units using the equity method of accounting. Enable is considered to be a VIE because the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact Enable’s economic performance does not reside with the holders of equity investment at risk. However, CenterPoint Energy is not considered the primary beneficiary of Enable since it does not have the power to direct the activities of Enable that are considered most significant to the economic performance of Enable. As of December\\xa031, 2019, CenterPoint Energy’s maximum exposure to loss related to Enable is limited to its investment in unconsolidated affiliate, its investment in Enable Series A Preferred Units and outstanding current accounts receivable from Enable.

An impairment loss is recognized in earnings when an impairment is deemed to be other than temporary. As of December 31, 2019, CenterPoint Energy’s investment in Enable is $10.29 per unit and Enable’s common unit price closed at $10.03 per unit (approximately $61 million below carrying value). Based on an analysis of its investment in Enable as of December 31, 2019, CenterPoint Energy believes that the decline in the value of its investment is temporary, and that the carrying value of its investment of $2.4 billion will be recovered.Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Affiliates, net (CenterPoint Energy):\\xa0Year Ended December 31,\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017\\xa0(in millions)Enable (1)$229\\xa0$307\\xa0$265Other 1\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0\\xa0Total$230\\xa0$307\\xa0$265(1)Equity earnings for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes CenterPoint Energy’s share of Enable’s $86 million goodwill impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019.Limited Partner Interest and Units Held in Enable (CenterPoint Energy):\\xa0As of December 31,\\xa020192018\\xa0Limited Partner Interest (1)\\xa0Common Units\\xa0Enable Series A Preferred Units (2)\\xa0Limited Partner Interest (1)\\xa0Common Units\\xa0Enable Series A Preferred Units (2)CenterPoint Energy (3)53.7%\\xa0233,856,623\\xa014,520,000\\xa054.0%\\xa0233,856,623\\xa014,520,000OGE25.5%\\xa0110,982,805\\xa0—\\xa025.6%\\xa0110,982,805\\xa0—Public unitholders20.8%\\xa090,361,937\\xa0—\\xa020.4%\\xa088,392,983\\xa0—Total Units Outstanding100.0%\\xa0435,201,365\\xa014,520,000\\xa0100.0%\\xa0433,232,411\\xa014,520,000(1)Excludes the Enable Series A Preferred Units owned by CenterPoint Energy.(2)The carrying amount of the Enable Series A Preferred Units, reflected as Preferred units - unconsolidated affiliate on CenterPoint Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, was $363 million as of both December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018.

If cash distributions to Enable’s unitholders exceed $0.330625 per common unit in any quarter, Enable GP will receive increasing percentages or incentive distributions rights, up to 50%, of the cash Enable distributes in excess of that amount. In certain circumstances Enable GP will have the right to reset the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels at which the incentive distributions receive increasing percentages to higher levels based on Enable’s cash distributions at the time of the exercise of this reset election.

CERC executed the Internal Spin to, among other things, enhance the access of CERC and CenterPoint Energy to low cost debt and equity through increased transparency and understandability of the financial statements, improve CERC’s credit quality by eliminating the exposure to Enable’s midstream business and provide clarity of internal reporting and performance metrics to enhance management’s decision making for CERC and CNP Midstream.The Internal Spin represents a significant strategic shift that has a material effect on CERC’s operations and financial results and, as a result, CERC’s distribution of its equity investment in Enable met the criteria for discontinued operations classification. CERC has no continuing involvement in the equity investment of Enable. Therefore, CERC’s equity in earnings and related income taxes have been classified as Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, in CERC’s Statements of Consolidated Income for the periods presented. CERC’s equity method investment and related deferred income tax liabilities have been classified as Investment in unconsolidated affiliate - discontinued operations and Deferred income taxes, net - discontinued operations, respectively, in CERC’s Consolidated Balance Sheets for the periods presented. The following table presents amounts included in Income from discontinued operations, net of tax in CERC’s Statements of Consolidated Income.\\xa0\\xa0Year Ended December 31,\\xa0\\xa02018\\xa02017\\xa0\\xa0(in millions)Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate, net\\xa0$184\\xa0$265Income tax expense\\xa046\\xa0104Income from discontinued operations, net of tax\\xa0$138\\xa0$161172(12)   Indexed Debt Securities (ZENS) and Securities Related to ZENS (CenterPoint Energy) (a) Investment in Securities Related to ZENSA subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy holds shares of certain securities detailed in the table below, which are classified as trading securities and are expected to be held to facilitate CenterPoint Energy’s ability to meet its obligation under the ZENS. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in the market value of the ZENS-Related Securities are recorded in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income.\\xa0\\xa0Shares Held at December 31, \\xa0\\xa02019\\xa02018AT&T Common\\xa010,212,945\\xa010,212,945Charter Common\\xa0872,503\\xa0872,912(b) ZENSIn September 1999, CenterPoint Energy issued ZENS having an original principal amount of $1.0 billion of which $828\\xa0million remained outstanding as of December\\xa031, 2019. Each ZENS is exchangeable at the holder’s option at any time for an amount of cash equal to 95% of the market value of the reference shares attributable to such note. The number and identity of the reference shares attributable to each ZENS are adjusted for certain corporate events. \\xa0CenterPoint Energy’s reference shares for each ZENS consisted of the following:\\xa0\\xa0December 31,\\xa0\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa0\\xa0(in shares)AT&T Common\\xa00.7185\\xa00.7185Charter Common\\xa00.061382\\xa00.061382CenterPoint Energy pays interest on the ZENS at an annual rate of 2% plus the amount of any quarterly cash dividends paid in respect of the reference shares attributable to the ZENS. The principal amount of the ZENS is subject to increases or decreases to the extent that the annual yield from interest and cash dividends on the reference shares is less than or more than 2.309%. The adjusted principal amount is defined in the ZENS instrument as “contingent principal.” As of December\\xa031, 2019, the ZENS, having an original principal amount of $828 million and a contingent principal amount of $75 million, were outstanding and were exchangeable, at the option of the holders, for cash equal to 95% of the market value of the reference shares attributable to the ZENS. As of December\\xa031, 2019, the market value of such shares was approximately $822 million, which would provide an exchange amount of $944 for each $1,000 original principal amount of ZENS. At maturity of the ZENS in 2029, CenterPoint Energy will be obligated to pay in cash the higher of the contingent principal amount of the ZENS or an amount based on the then-current market value of the reference shares, which will include any additional publicly-traded securities distributed with respect to the current reference shares prior to maturity. The ZENS obligation is bifurcated into a debt component and a derivative component (the holder’s option to receive the appreciated value of the reference shares at maturity). The bifurcated debt component accretes through interest charges annually up to the contingent principal amount of the ZENS in 2029. Such accretion will be reduced by annual cash interest payments, as described above. The derivative component is recorded at fair value and changes in the fair value of the derivative component are recorded in CenterPoint Energy’s Statements of Consolidated Income. Changes in the fair value of the ZENS-Related Securities held by CenterPoint Energy are expected to substantially offset changes in the fair value of the derivative component of the ZENS.173The following table sets forth summarized financial information regarding CenterPoint Energy’s investment in ZENS-Related Securities and each component of CenterPoint Energy’s ZENS obligation.\\xa0\\xa0ZENS-Related Securities\\xa0DebtComponentof ZENS\\xa0DerivativeComponentof ZENS\\xa0(in millions)Balance as of December 31, 2016$953\\xa0$114\\xa0$717Accretion of debt component of ZENS—\\xa027\\xa0—2% interest paid—\\xa0(17)\\xa0—Distribution to ZENS holders—\\xa0(2)\\xa0—Gain on indexed debt securities—\\xa0—\\xa0(49)Gain on ZENS-Related Securities7\\xa0—\\xa0—Balance as of December 31, 2017960\\xa0122\\xa0668Accretion of debt component of ZENS—\\xa021\\xa0—2% interest paid—\\xa0(17)\\xa0—Sale of ZENS-Related Securities(398)\\xa0—\\xa0—Distribution to ZENS holders—\\xa0(102)\\xa0(46)Gain on indexed debt securities—\\xa0—\\xa0(21)Loss on ZENS-Related Securities(22)\\xa0—\\xa0—Balance as of December 31, 2018540\\xa024\\xa0601Accretion of debt component of ZENS—\\xa017\\xa0—2% interest paid—\\xa0(17)\\xa0—Distribution to ZENS holders—\\xa0(5)\\xa0—Loss on indexed debt securities—\\xa0—\\xa0292Gain on ZENS-Related Securities282\\xa0—\\xa0—Balance as of December 31, 2019$822\\xa0$19\\xa0$893(13)   Equity (CenterPoint Energy) Dividends Declared and Paid  (CenterPoint Energy)CenterPoint Energy declared dividends on its Common Stock during 2019, 2018 and 2017 as presented in the table below:Declaration Date\\xa0Record Date\\xa0Payment Date\\xa0Per Share\\xa0Total(in millions)October 17, 2019\\xa0November 21, 2019\\xa0December 12, 2019\\xa0$0.2875\\xa0$144July 31, 2019\\xa0August 15, 2019\\xa0September 12, 2019\\xa00.2875\\xa0145April 25, 2019\\xa0May 16, 2019\\xa0June 13, 2019\\xa00.2875\\xa0144Total 2019\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$0.8625\\xa0$433\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0December 12, 2018\\xa0February 21, 2019\\xa0March 14, 2019\\xa0$0.2875\\xa0$144October 23, 2018\\xa0November 15, 2018\\xa0December 13, 2018\\xa00.2775\\xa0139July 26, 2018\\xa0August 16, 2018\\xa0September 13, 2018\\xa00.2775\\xa0120April 26, 2018\\xa0May 17, 2018\\xa0June 14, 2018\\xa00.2775\\xa0120Total 2018\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$1.1200\\xa0$523\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0174Declaration Date\\xa0Record Date\\xa0Payment Date\\xa0Per Share\\xa0Total(in millions)December 13, 2017\\xa0February 15, 2018\\xa0March 8, 2018\\xa0$0.2775\\xa0$120October 25, 2017\\xa0November 16, 2017\\xa0December 8, 2017\\xa00.2675\\xa0116July 27, 2017\\xa0August 16, 2017\\xa0September 8, 2017\\xa00.2675\\xa0115April 27, 2017\\xa0May 16, 2017\\xa0June 9, 2017\\xa00.2675\\xa0115January 5, 2017\\xa0February 16, 2017\\xa0March 10, 2017\\xa00.2675\\xa0115Total 2017\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$1.3475\\xa0$581CenterPoint Energy declared  dividends on its Series A Preferred Stock during 2019 and 2018 as presented in the table below:Declaration Date\\xa0Record Date\\xa0Payment Date\\xa0Per Share\\xa0Total(in millions)July 31, 2019\\xa0August 15, 2019\\xa0September 3, 2019\\xa0$30.6250\\xa0$24Total 2019\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$30.6250\\xa0$24\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0December 12, 2018\\xa0February 15, 2019\\xa0March 1, 2019\\xa0$32.1563\\xa0$26Total 2018\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$32.1563\\xa0$26CenterPoint Energy declared  dividends on its Series B Preferred Stock during 2019 and 2018 as presented in the table below:Declaration Date\\xa0Record Date\\xa0Payment Date\\xa0Per Share\\xa0Total(in millions)October 17, 2019\\xa0November 15, 2019\\xa0December 2, 2019\\xa0$17.5000\\xa0$17July 31, 2019\\xa0August 15, 2019\\xa0September 3, 2019\\xa017.5000\\xa017April 25, 2019\\xa0May 15, 2019\\xa0June 3, 2019\\xa017.5000\\xa017Total 2019\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$52.5000\\xa0$51\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0December 12, 2018\\xa0February 15, 2019\\xa0March 1, 2019\\xa0$17.5000\\xa0$17October 23, 2018\\xa0November 15, 2018\\xa0December 1, 2018\\xa011.6667\\xa011Total 2018\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$29.1667\\xa0$28There were no Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock outstanding or dividends declared in 2017.Dividend Requirement on Preferred Stock \\xa0Year Ended December 31,\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017\\xa0(in millions)Series A Preferred Stock$49\\xa0$18\\xa0$—Series B Preferred Stock68\\xa017\\xa0—Total preferred stock dividend requirement$117\\xa0$35\\xa0$—Series A Preferred Stock On August\\xa022, 2018, CenterPoint Energy completed the issuance of 800,000 shares of its Series A Preferred Stock, at a price of $1,000 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $790 million after issuance costs.

Correspondingly, the conversion rate per depositary share will be not less than 1.5291 and not more than 1.8349 shares of Common Stock, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments. The conversion rate will be determined based on a preceding\\xa020-day\\xa0volume-weighted-average-price of Common Stock.The following table illustrates the conversion rate per share of the Series B Preferred Stock, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments:Applicable Market Value of the Common Stock\\xa0Conversion Rate per Share of Series B Preferred StockGreater than $32.6990 (threshold appreciation price)\\xa030.5820 shares of Common StockEqual to or less than $32.6990 but greater than or equal to $27.2494\\xa0Between 30.5820 and 36.6980 shares of Common Stock, determined by dividing $1,000 by the applicable market valueLess than $27.2494 (initial price)\\xa036.6980 shares of Common StockThe following table illustrates the conversion rate per depositary share, subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments:Applicable Market Value of the Common Stock\\xa0Conversion Rate per Depository ShareGreater than $32.6990 (threshold appreciation price)\\xa01.5291 shares of Common StockEqual to or less than $32.6990 but greater than or equal to $27.2494\\xa0Between 1.5291 and 1.8349 shares of Common Stock, determined by dividing $50 by the applicable market valueLess than $27.2494 (initial price)\\xa01.8349 shares of Common StockOptional Conversion of the Holder. Other than during a fundamental change conversion period, and unless CenterPoint Energy has redeemed the Series B Preferred Stock, a holder of the Series B Preferred Stock may, at any time prior to September 1, 2021, elect to convert such holder’s shares of the Series B Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at the minimum conversion rate of 30.5820 shares of Common Stock per share of the Series B Preferred Stock (equivalent to 1.5291 shares of Common Stock per depositary share), subject to certain anti-dilution and other adjustments. Because each depositary share represents a 1/20th fractional interest in a share of the Series B Preferred Stock, a holder of depositary shares may convert its depositary shares only in lots of 20 depositary shares. Fundamental Change Conversion. If a fundamental change occurs on or prior to September 1, 2021, holders of the Series B Preferred Stock will have the right to convert their shares of the Series B Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, into shares of Common Stock at the fundamental change conversion rate during the period beginning on, and including, the effective date of such fundamental change and ending on, and including, the date that is 20 calendar days after such effective date (or, if later, the date that is 20 calendar days after holders receive notice of such fundamental change, but in no event later than September 1, 2021). Holders who convert shares of the Series B Preferred Stock during that period will also receive a make-whole dividend amount comprised of a fundamental change dividend make-whole amount, and to the extent there is any, the accumulated dividend amount. Because each depositary share represents a 1/20th fractional interest in a share of the Series B Preferred Stock, a holder of depositary shares may convert its depositary shares upon a fundamental change only in lots of 20 depositary shares. Ranking. The Series B Preferred Stock, with respect to anticipated dividends and distributions upon CenterPoint Energy’s liquidation or dissolution, or winding-up of CenterPoint Energy’s affairs, ranks or will rank:•senior to Common Stock and to each other class or series of capital stock established after the initial issue date of the Series B Preferred Stock that is expressly made subordinated to the Series B Preferred Stock;•on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock and any class or series of capital stock established after the initial issue date that is not expressly made senior or subordinated to the Series B Preferred Stock;177•junior to any class or series of capital stock established after the initial issue date that is expressly made senior to the Series B Preferred Stock;•junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including indebtedness outstanding under CenterPoint Energy’s credit facilities, senior notes and commercial paper) and other liabilities with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against CenterPoint Energy; and•structurally subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of CenterPoint Energy’s subsidiaries and capital stock of CenterPoint Energy’s subsidiaries held by third parties.Voting Rights. Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock generally will not have voting rights. Whenever dividends on shares of the Series B Preferred Stock have not been declared and paid for six or more dividend periods (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the dividend period beginning on, and including, the initial issue date and ending on, but excluding, December 1, 2018), whether or not consecutive, the holders of such shares of Series B Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class with holders of any and all other series of voting preferred stock then outstanding (as defined in the Statement of Resolution for the Series B Preferred Stock), will be entitled at CenterPoint Energy’s next annual or special meeting of shareholders to vote for the election of a total of two additional members of CenterPoint Energy’s Board of Directors, subject to certain limitations. This right will terminate if and when all accumulated and unpaid dividends have been paid in full and, upon such termination, the term of office of each director so elected will terminate at such time and the number of directors on CenterPoint Energy’s Board of Directors will automatically decrease by two, subject to the revesting of such rights in the event of each subsequent nonpayment.Common StockOn October\\xa01, 2018, CenterPoint Energy completed the issuance of 69,633,027 shares of Common Stock at a price of $27.25 per share, for net proceeds of $1,844 million after issuance costs. The amount issued included 9,082,568 shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the exercise in full of the option granted to the underwriters to purchase additional shares of Common Stock.CenterPoint Energy used the net proceeds from the Common Stock offering to fund a portion of the Merger and to pay related fees and expenses.Undistributed Retained EarningsAs of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, CenterPoint Energy’s consolidated retained earnings balance includes undistributed earnings from Enable of $-0- and $31 million, respectively.  178Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)Changes in accumulated comprehensive income (loss) are as follows: \\xa0Year Ended December 31,\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0(in millions)Beginning Balance$(108)\\xa0$(14)\\xa0$5\\xa0$(68)\\xa0$—\\xa0$6Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Remeasurement of pension and other postretirement plans7\\xa0—\\xa07\\xa0(19)\\xa0—\\xa01Deferred loss from interest rate derivatives (1)(3)\\xa0(1)\\xa0—\\xa0(19)\\xa0(18)\\xa0(1)Reclassified to earnings1\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0—Other comprehensive loss from unconsolidated affiliates(1)\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0—Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Prior service cost (2)1\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa01\\xa0—\\xa01Actuarial losses (2)8\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa06\\xa0—\\xa0—Tax benefit (expense)(3)\\xa0—\\xa0(2)\\xa06\\xa04\\xa0(1)Net current period other comprehensive income (loss)10\\xa0(1)\\xa05\\xa0(25)\\xa0(14)\\xa0—Adoption of ASU 2018-02—\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0(15)\\xa0—\\xa0(1)Ending Balance$(98)\\xa0$(15)\\xa0$10\\xa0$(108)\\xa0$(14)\\xa0$5(1)Gains and losses are reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive income into income when the hedged transactions affect earnings.

For additional information regarding ZENS, see Note 12(b). As ZENS are exchangeable for cash at any time at the option of the holders, these notes are classified as a current portion of long-term debt.(3)Includes $532 million of senior notes issued by VUHI and $96 million of senior notes issued by Indiana Gas. The senior notes have stated interest rates that range from 3.72% to 7.08%. The senior notes issued by VUHI are guaranteed by SIGECO, Indiana Gas and VEDO. In connection with the Merger, two of CenterPoint Energy’s acquired wholly-owned subsidiaries, VUHI and VCC, made offers to prepay certain outstanding guaranteed senior notes as required pursuant to certain note purchase agreements previously entered into by VUHI and VCC. In turn, VUHI and VCC borrowed $568\\xa0million and $191 million, respectively, from CenterPoint Energy to fund note redemptions of senior notes effected pursuant to these prepayment offers. To fund these prepayments and payments of approximately $5 million of accrued interest, CenterPoint Energy issued approximately $764 million of commercial paper.(4)The first mortgage bonds issued by SIGECO subject SIGECO’s properties to a lien under the related mortgage indenture. (5)$68 million and $68 million of these series of debt were secured by general mortgage bonds of Houston Electric as of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These general mortgage bonds are not reflected in Houston Electric’s consolidated financial statements because of the contingent nature of the obligations. (6)Classified as long-term debt because the termination date of the facility that backstops the commercial paper is more than one year from the date noted.180(7)Commercial paper issued by VUHI has maturities up to 30 days.(8)Issued by CERC Corp.Long-term DebtDebt Retirements.

As of December\\xa031, 2019, CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric had special purpose subsidiaries consisting of the Bond Companies, which they consolidate. The consolidated special purpose subsidiaries are wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote entities that were formed solely for the purpose of purchasing and owning transition or system restoration property through the issuance of transition bonds or system restoration bonds and activities incidental thereto. These Securitization Bonds are payable only through the imposition and collection of “transition” or “system restoration” charges, as defined in the Texas Public Utility Regulatory Act, which are irrevocable, non-bypassable charges to provide recovery of authorized qualified costs. CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric have no payment obligations in respect of the Securitization Bonds other than to remit the applicable transition or system restoration charges they collect as set forth in servicing agreements among Houston Electric, the Bond Companies and other parties. Each special purpose entity is the sole owner of the right to impose, collect and receive the applicable transition or system restoration charges securing the bonds issued by that entity. Creditors of CenterPoint Energy or Houston Electric have no recourse to any assets or revenues of the Bond Companies (including the transition and system restoration charges), and the holders of Securitization Bonds have no recourse to the assets or revenues of CenterPoint Energy or Houston Electric.181Credit Facilities.

Sinking or improvement fund and replacement fund requirements on the first mortgage bonds may be satisfied by certification of property additions. Sinking fund and replacement fund requirements for 2019, 2018 and 2017 have been satisfied by certification of property additions. The replacement fund requirement to be satisfied in 2020 is approximately $295 million, and the sinking fund requirement to be satisfied in 2020 is approximately $1.6 million. CenterPoint Energy expects Houston Electric to meet these 2020 obligations by certification of property additions. As of December\\xa031, 2019, Houston Electric’s assets were also subject to liens securing approximately $4.0 billion of general mortgage bonds, including approximately $68 million held in trust to secure pollution control bonds for which CenterPoint Energy is obligated. The lien of the general mortgage indenture is junior to that of the mortgage pursuant to which the first mortgage bonds are issued. Houston Electric may issue additional general mortgage bonds on the basis of retired bonds, 70% of property additions or cash deposited with the trustee.\\xa0Approximately $3.7 billion of additional first mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds could be issued on the basis of retired bonds and 70% of property additions as of December\\xa031, 2019.

Also recorded an additional $11 million valuation allowance on certain state net operating loss deferred tax assets that are no longer expected to be utilized prior to expiration after the Internal Spin. These items are partially offset by $24 million of amortization of the net regulatory EDIT liability as decreed by regulators in certain jurisdictions beginning in 2018.(3)Recognized a $1.1 billion deferred tax benefit from the remeasurement of CenterPoint Energy’s ADFIT liability as a result of the enactment of the TCJA on December 22, 2017, which reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%.(4)Recognized $21 million of amortization of the net regulatory EDIT liability as decreed by regulators.

(9)Recognized a\\xa0$396 million\\xa0deferred tax benefit from the remeasurement of CERC’s ADFIT liability as a result of the enactment of the TCJA on December 22, 2017, which reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from\\xa035% to\\xa021%. ASC 740 requires tax impacts of changes in tax laws or rates be reported in continuing operations.\\xa0Therefore, CERC’s federal income tax benefit generated by the remeasurement of the ADFIT liability for Enable during 2017 and state law changes during 2016 associated with its investment in Enable are reported in continuing operations on CERC’s Statements of Consolidated Income. The ADFIT liability associated with CERC’s investment in Enable is reported as discontinued operations on CERC’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\xa0 186The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:\\xa0December 31,\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa0(in millions)CenterPoint Energy\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Deferred tax assets:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Benefits and compensation$152\\xa0$160Regulatory liabilities447\\xa0356Loss and credit carryforwards111\\xa084Asset retirement obligations89\\xa062Indexed debt securities derivative34\\xa0—Other40\\xa029Valuation allowance(25)\\xa0(18)Total deferred tax assets848\\xa0673Deferred tax liabilities:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Property, plant and equipment2,656\\xa01,894Investment in unconsolidated affiliates1,010\\xa0987Regulatory assets344\\xa0395Investment in marketable securities and indexed debt586\\xa0478Indexed debt securities derivative—\\xa027Other180\\xa0131Total deferred tax liabilities4,776\\xa03,912Net deferred tax liabilities$3,928\\xa0$3,239Houston Electric\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Deferred tax assets:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Regulatory liabilities$195\\xa0$205Benefits and compensation14\\xa017Asset retirement obligations9\\xa07Other7\\xa012Total deferred tax assets225\\xa0241Deferred tax liabilities:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Property, plant and equipment1,129\\xa01,087Regulatory assets126\\xa0177Total deferred tax liabilities1,255\\xa01,264Net deferred tax liabilities$1,030\\xa0$1,023CERC - Continuing Operations\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Deferred tax assets:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Benefits and compensation$24\\xa0$27Regulatory liabilities144\\xa0150Loss and credit carryforwards183\\xa0259Asset retirement obligations80\\xa054Other23\\xa020Valuation allowance(15)\\xa0(18)Total deferred tax assets439\\xa0492Deferred tax liabilities:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Property, plant and equipment821\\xa0773Regulatory assets45\\xa041Other43\\xa084Total deferred tax liabilities909\\xa0898Net deferred tax liabilities$470\\xa0$406187Merger with Vectren.  On  Merger Date, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, CenterPoint Energy consummated the Merger and acquired Vectren for approximately $6 billion in cash.  On the Merger Date, Vectren became a wholly-owned subsidiary of CenterPoint Energy which triggered an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code.  Under this Code section, future utilization of acquired net operating loss carry forwards and other tax attributes can be limited. On the Merger Date, Vectren  estimated $177 million and $60 million of federal net operating loss and of charitable contribution carryforwards, respectively, the utilization of which is not expected to be limited under Section 382.Tax Attribute Carryforwards and Valuation Allowance.\\xa0\\xa0CenterPoint Energy has no federal net operating loss carryforwards as of December\\xa031, 2019.  Also, CenterPoint Energy has $26 million of federal charitable contribution carryforwards, which have a five-year carryover period. As of December 31, 2019, CenterPoint Energy had $699 million of state net operating loss carryforwards that expire between 2020 and 2039 and $21 million of state tax credits that do not expire. CenterPoint Energy reported a valuation allowance of $25 million because it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized.CERC has\\xa0$618 million\\xa0of federal net operating loss carryforwards which have an indefinite carryforward period. CERC has\\xa0$691 million\\xa0of state net operating loss carryforwards which expire between\\xa02020\\xa0and 2039\\xa0and $17 million\\xa0of state tax credits which do not expire. CERC reported a valuation allowance of\\xa0$15 million\\xa0since it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized.A reconciliation of CenterPoint Energy’s beginning and ending balance of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, for 2019 is as follows:\\xa0Year Ended December 31, 2019\\xa0(in millions)Balance, beginning of year$—\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Unrecognized tax benefits assumed through the Merger9\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Decreases related to tax positions of prior years(1)Balance, end of year$8CenterPoint Energy had no unrecognized tax benefits for 2018 and 2017.During the year ended December 31, 2019, CenterPoint Energy acquired $9 million of unrecognized tax benefits in connection with the Merger.  Included in the balance of uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2019 are $3 million of tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. The above table does not include an immaterial amount of accrued interest as of December 31, 2019. The Registrants recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties as income tax expense. The Registrants believe that it is reasonably possible that a decrease of up to $5 million in unrecognized tax benefits may occur by the end of 2020 as a result of a lapse of statutes on older exposures and/or the filing of applications for accounting method changes. CenterPoint Energy’s net unrecognized tax benefits, including penalties and interest, were $9 million as of December 31, 2019 and are included in other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements.Tax Audits and Settlements. Tax years through 2017 have been audited and settled with the IRS for CenterPoint Energy. For the 2018 and 2019 tax years, the Registrants are participants in the IRS’s Compliance Assurance Process. Legacy Vectren is not currently under audit with the IRS, and the 2017-2019 tax years are still open.(16)   Commitments and Contingencies (a) Purchase Obligations (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)Commitments include minimum purchase obligations related to CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas Distribution and Energy Services reportable segments and CenterPoint Energy’s Indiana Electric Integrated reportable segment.\\xa0Contracts with minimum payment provisions have various quantity requirements and durations and are not classified as non-trading derivative assets and liabilities in CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018. These contracts meet an exception as “normal purchases contracts” or do not meet the definition of a derivative. Natural gas and coal supply commitments also include transportation contracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative. 188As of December\\xa031, 2019, minimum purchase obligations are approximately:\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0CERC\\xa0(in millions)2020$750\\xa0$5332021617\\xa04322022418\\xa02422023335\\xa01822024271\\xa01742025 and beyond1,888\\xa01,526Indiana Electric also has other purchased power agreements that do not have minimum thresholds but do require payment when energy is generated by the provider. Costs arising from certain of these commitments are pass-through costs, generally collected dollar-for-dollar from retail customers through regulator-approved cost recovery mechanisms. (b) AMAs (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD has AMAs associated with their utility distribution service in Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas. The AMAs have varying terms, the longest of which expires in 2023. Pursuant to the provisions of the agreements, CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD either sells natural gas to the asset manager and agrees to repurchase an equivalent amount of natural gas throughout the year at the same cost, or simply purchases its full natural gas requirements at each delivery point from the asset manager. Generally, AMAs are contracts between CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD and an asset manager that are intended to transfer the working capital obligation and maximize the utilization of the assets. In these agreements, CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD agrees to release transportation and storage capacity to other parties to manage natural gas storage, supply and delivery arrangements for CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD and to use the released capacity for other purposes when it is not needed for CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD may receive compensation from the asset manager through payments made over the life of the AMAs.\\xa0CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s NGD has an obligation to purchase their winter storage requirements that have been released to the asset manager under these AMAs.(c) Guarantees and Product Warranties (CenterPoint Energy)In the normal course of business, ESG enters into contracts requiring it to timely install infrastructure, operate facilities, pay vendors and subcontractors and support warranty obligations and, at times, issue payment and performance bonds and other forms of assurance in connection with these contracts.Specific to ESG’s role as a general contractor in the performance contracting industry, as of December\\xa031, 2019, there were 62 open surety bonds supporting future performance with an aggregate face amount of approximately $565 million. ESG’s exposure is less than the face amount of the surety bonds and is limited to the level of uncompleted work under the contracts. As of December\\xa031, 2019, approximately 36% of the work was yet to be completed on projects with open surety bonds. Further, various subcontractors issue surety bonds to ESG. In addition to these performance obligations, ESG also warrants the functionality of certain installed infrastructure generally for one year and the associated energy savings over a specified number of years.\\xa0Since ESG’s inception in 1994, CenterPoint Energy believes ESG has had a history of generally meeting its performance obligations and energy savings guarantees and its installed products operating effectively. CenterPoint Energy assessed the fair value of its obligation for such guarantees as of December\\xa031, 2019 and no amounts were recorded on CenterPoint Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. CenterPoint Energy issues parent company level guarantees to certain vendors, customers and other commercial counterparties of ESG. These guarantees do not represent incremental consolidated obligations, but rather, represent guarantees of subsidiary obligations to allow those subsidiaries to conduct business without posting other forms of assurance. As of December\\xa031, 2019, CenterPoint Energy, primarily through Vectren, has issued parent company level guarantees supporting ESG’s obligations. For those obligations where potential exposure can be estimated, management estimates the maximum exposure under these guarantees to be approximately $499 million as of December\\xa031, 2019.\\xa0This exposure primarily relates to energy savings guarantees on federal energy savings performance contracts.\\xa0Other parent company level guarantees, certain of which do not contain a cap on potential liability, have been issued in support of federal operations and maintenance projects for which a maximum exposure cannot be estimated based on the nature of the projects. While there can be no assurance that performance under any of these parent company 189guarantees will not be required in the future, CenterPoint Energy considers the likelihood of a material amount being incurred as remote.(d) Guarantees and Product Warranties (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)In the normal course of business, CES trades natural gas under supply contracts and enters into natural gas related transactions under transportation, storage and other contracts.  In connection with these CES business activities, CERC Corp. has issued guarantees to CES counterparties to guarantee the payment of CES obligations.  While CES remains wholly-owned by CERC Corp., these guarantees do not represent incremental consolidated obligations, but rather, represent guarantees of CES’s obligations to allow CES to conduct business without posting other forms of assurance.  As of December 31, 2019, the face amount of CERC Corp.’s guarantees of CES obligations was approximately $1.8 billion. A CERC Corp. guarantee primarily has a one- or two-year term, although CERC Corp. would generally not be released from obligations incurred by CES prior to the termination of such guarantee unless the beneficiary of the guarantee affirmatively released CERC Corp.  from its obligations under the guarantee.  Since CERC Corp. has owned CES, CERC Corp. has not paid any amounts under any guarantees of CES obligations.  While there can be no assurance that performance under any of these parent company guarantees will not be required in the future, CenterPoint Energy and CERC consider the likelihood of a material amount being incurred as remote.On February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reportable segment.  Under the terms of the Equity Purchase Agreement, Athena Energy Services must generally use reasonable best efforts to replace existing CERC Corp. guarantees with credit support provided by a party other than CERC Corp. as of and after closing of the sale.  Additionally, to the extent that CERC Corp. retains any exposure relating to the guarantees of CES obligations 90 days after closing, Athena Energy Services will pay a 3% annualized fee on such exposure, increasing by 1% on an annualized basis every three months. CenterPoint Energy and CERC recorded no amounts on their respective Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 related to these guarantees. (e) Legal, Environmental and Other MattersLegal MattersGas Market Manipulation Cases (CenterPoint Energy and CERC).\\xa0CenterPoint Energy, its predecessor, Reliant Energy, and certain of their former subsidiaries were named as defendants in a large number of lawsuits filed against numerous gas market participants in a number of federal and western state courts in connection with the operation of the natural gas markets in 2000-2002. CenterPoint Energy and its affiliates were released or dismissed from all such cases, except for one case in federal court in Nevada in which CES, a subsidiary of CERC, was a defendant. Plaintiffs in that case alleged a conspiracy to inflate Wisconsin natural gas prices in 2000-2002.\\xa0In October 2018, CES reached an agreement to settle all claims against CES and CES’s claims for indemnity.  During the third quarter of 2019, the federal district court issued final approval of the settlement and dismissed the case, and CES completed the required settlement payments; the settlement agreement has now become final. This settlement did not have a material adverse effect on CenterPoint Energy’s or CERC’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Minnehaha Academy (CenterPoint Energy and CERC).\\xa0On August 2, 2017, a natural gas explosion occurred at the Minnehaha Academy in Minneapolis, Minnesota, resulting in the deaths of two school employees, serious injuries to others and significant property damage to the school.\\xa0CenterPoint Energy, certain of its subsidiaries, including CERC, and the contractor company working in the school have been named in litigation arising out of this incident.\\xa0CenterPoint Energy and CERC have reached confidential settlement agreements on all wrongful death and property damage claims and with some personal injury claimants. Additionally, CenterPoint Energy and CERC cooperated with the investigation conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board, which concluded its investigation in December 2019 and issued a report without making any recommendations. Further, CenterPoint Energy and CERC contested and reached a settlement regarding approximately $200,000 in fines imposed by the Minnesota Office of Pipeline Safety.\\xa0 In early 2018, the Minnesota Occupational Safety and Health Administration concluded its investigation without any adverse findings against CenterPoint Energy or CERC. CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s general and excess liability insurance policies provide coverage for third party bodily injury and property damage claims.\\xa0Litigation Related to the Merger (CenterPoint Energy). With respect to the Merger, in July 2018, seven separate lawsuits were filed against Vectren and the individual directors of Vectren’s Board of Directors in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. These lawsuits alleged violations of Sections 14(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 14a-9 on the grounds that the Vectren Proxy Statement filed on June 18, 2018 was materially incomplete because it omitted material information concerning the Merger. In August 2018, the seven lawsuits were consolidated, and the Court denied the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary 190injunction. In October 2018, the plaintiffs filed their Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint. In December 2018, two plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their lawsuits. In September 2019, the court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss and dismissed the remaining plaintiffs’ claims with prejudice, which the plaintiffs appealed in October 2019. The defendants believe that the allegations asserted are without merit and intend to vigorously defend themselves against the claims raised. CenterPoint Energy does not expect the ultimate outcome of this matter to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Environmental MattersMGP Sites. CenterPoint Energy, CERC and their predecessors operated MGPs in the past. In addition, certain of CenterPoint Energy’s subsidiaries acquired through the Merger operated MGPs in the past. The costs CenterPoint Energy or CERC, as applicable, expect to incur to fulfill their respective obligations are estimated by management using assumptions based on actual costs incurred, the timing of expected future payments and inflation factors, among others. While CenterPoint Energy and CERC have recorded all costs which they presently are obligated to incur in connection with activities at these sites, it is possible that future events may require remedial activities which are not presently foreseen, and those costs may not be subject to PRP or insurance recovery. (i)Minnesota MGPs (CenterPoint Energy and CERC). With respect to certain Minnesota MGP sites, CenterPoint Energy and CERC have completed state-ordered remediation and continue state-ordered monitoring and water treatment. CenterPoint Energy and CERC recorded a liability as reflected in the table below for continued monitoring and any future remediation required by regulators in Minnesota. (ii)Indiana MGPs (CenterPoint Energy). In the Indiana Gas service territory, the existence, location and certain general characteristics of 26 gas manufacturing and storage sites have been identified for which CenterPoint Energy may have some remedial responsibility. A remedial investigation/feasibility study was completed at one of the sites under an agreed upon order between Indiana Gas and the IDEM, and a Record of Decision was issued by the IDEM in January 2000. The remaining sites have been submitted to the IDEM’s VRP. CenterPoint Energy has also identified its involvement in five manufactured gas plant sites in SIGECO’s service territory, all of which are currently enrolled in the IDEM’s VRP. CenterPoint Energy is currently conducting some level of remedial activities, including groundwater monitoring at certain sites.(iii)Other MGPs (CenterPoint Energy and CERC). In addition to the Minnesota and Indiana sites, the EPA and other regulators have investigated MGP sites that were owned or operated by CenterPoint Energy or CERC or may have been owned by one of their former affiliates.  Total costs that may be incurred in connection with addressing these sites cannot be determined at this time. The estimated accrued costs are limited to CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s share of the remediation efforts and are therefore net of exposures of other PRPs. The estimated range of possible remediation costs for the sites for which CenterPoint Energy and CERC believe they may have responsibility was based on remediation continuing for the minimum time frame given in the table below. \\xa0December\\xa031, 2019\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0CERC\\xa0(in millions, except years)Amount accrued for remediation$12\\xa0$7Minimum estimated remediation costs7\\xa04Maximum estimated remediation costs51\\xa032Minimum years of remediation5\\xa030Maximum years of remediation50\\xa050The cost estimates are based on studies of a site or industry average costs for remediation of sites of similar size. The actual remediation costs will depend on the number of sites to be remediated, the participation of other PRPs, if any, and the remediation methods used. CenterPoint Energy and CERC do not expect the ultimate outcome of these matters to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of either CenterPoint Energy or CERC.Asbestos. Some facilities owned by the Registrants or their predecessors contain or have contained asbestos insulation and other asbestos-containing materials. The Registrants are from time to time named, along with numerous others, as defendants in 191lawsuits filed by a number of individuals who claim injury due to exposure to asbestos, and the Registrants anticipate that additional claims may be asserted in the future.\\xa0Although their ultimate outcome cannot be predicted at this time, the Registrants do not expect these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on their financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.CCR Rule (CenterPoint Energy). In April 2015, the EPA finalized its CCR Rule, which regulates ash as non-hazardous material under the RCRA. The final rule allows beneficial reuse of ash, and the majority of the ash generated by Indiana Electric’s generating plants will continue to be reused.\\xa0In July 2018, the EPA released its final CCR Rule Phase I Reconsideration which extended the deadline to October 31, 2020 for ceasing placement of ash in ponds that exceed groundwater protections standards or that fail to meet location restrictions. While the EPA Phase I Reconsideration moves forward, the existing CCR compliance obligations remain in effect. In August 2019, the EPA proposed additional amendments to its CCR Rule with respect to beneficial reuse of ash and other materials. The proposed revisions would not restrict Indiana Electric’s current beneficial reuse of its fly ash.Indiana Electric has three ash ponds, two at the F.B. Culley facility (Culley East and Culley West) and one at the A.B. Brown facility. Under the existing CCR Rule, Indiana Electric is required to perform integrity assessments, including ground water monitoring, at its F.B. Culley and A.B. Brown generating stations.\\xa0The ground water studies are necessary to determine the remaining service life of the ponds and whether a pond must be retrofitted with liners or closed in place, with bottom ash handling conversions completed. Indiana Electric’s Warrick generating unit is not included in the scope of the CCR Rule as this unit has historically been part of a larger generating station that predominantly serves an adjacent industrial facility. In March 2018, Indiana Electric began posting ground water data monitoring reports annually to its public website in accordance with the requirements of the CCR Rule. This data preliminarily indicates potential groundwater impacts very close to Indiana Electric’s ash impoundments, and further analysis is ongoing. The CCR Rule required companies to complete location restriction determinations by October 18, 2018. Indiana Electric completed its evaluation and determined that one F.B. Culley pond (Culley East) and the A.B. Brown pond fail the aquifer placement location restriction.\\xa0As a result of this failure, Indiana Electric is required to cease disposal of new ash in the ponds and commence closure of the ponds by October 31, 2020.\\xa0CenterPoint Energy plans to seek extensions available under the CCR Rule that would allow Indiana Electric to continue to use the ponds through December 31, 2023. The inability to take these extensions may result in increased and potentially significant operational costs in connection with the accelerated implementation of an alternative ash disposal system or adversely impact Indiana Electric’s future operations. Failure to comply with these requirements could also result in an enforcement proceeding including the imposition of fines and penalties. On April 24, 2019, Indiana Electric received an order from the IURC approving recovery in rates of costs associated with the closure of the Culley West pond, which has already commenced closure activities. CenterPoint Energy believes the language in the IURC order is favorable for future recovery of closure costs for Indiana Electric’s remaining ponds.Indiana Electric continues to refine site specific estimates of closure costs.\\xa0In July 2018, Indiana Electric filed a Complaint for Damages and Declaratory Relief against its insurers seeking reimbursement of defense, investigation and pond closure costs incurred to comply with the CCR Rule, and has since reached confidential settlement agreements with its insurers.\\xa0The proceeds of these settlements will offset costs that have been and will be incurred to close the ponds. In March 2019, Indiana Electric entered into agreements with third parties for the excavation and beneficial reuse of the ash at the A.B. Brown ash pond.\\xa0On August 14, 2019, Indiana Electric filed its petition with the IURC for recovery of costs associated with the closure of the A.B. Brown ash pond, which would include costs associated with the excavation and recycling of the ponded ash. On November 4, 2019, the EPA released a pre-publication copy of proposed revisions to the CCR Rule.\\xa0CenterPoint Energy will evaluate the proposals to determine potential impacts to current compliance plans for its A.B. Brown and F.B. Culley generating stations.As of December\\xa031, 2019, CenterPoint Energy has recorded an approximate $68 million ARO, which represents the discounted value of future cash flow estimates to close the ponds at A.B. Brown and F.B. Culley. This estimate is subject to change due to the contractual arrangements; continued assessments of the ash, closure methods, and the timing of closure; implications of Indiana Electric’s generation transition plan; changing environmental regulations; and proceeds received from the settlements in the aforementioned insurance proceeding.\\xa0In addition to these removal costs, Indiana Electric also anticipates equipment purchases of between $60\\xa0million and $80 million to complete the A.B. Brown closure project. Other Environmental. From time to time, the Registrants identify the presence of environmental contaminants during operations or on property where predecessors have conducted operations.\\xa0Other such sites involving contaminants may be identified in the future.\\xa0The Registrants have and expect to continue to remediate any identified sites consistent with state and federal legal obligations.\\xa0From time to time, the Registrants have received notices, and may receive notices in the future, from regulatory authorities or others regarding status as a PRP in connection with sites found to require remediation due to the presence of environmental contaminants.  In addition, the Registrants have been, or may be, named from time to time as defendants in litigation related to such sites. Although the ultimate outcome of such matters cannot be predicted at this time, the Registrants do not expect these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on their financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.192Other ProceedingsThe Registrants are involved in other legal, environmental, tax and regulatory proceedings before various courts, regulatory commissions and governmental agencies regarding matters arising in the ordinary course of business. From time to time, the Registrants are also defendants in legal proceedings with respect to claims brought by various plaintiffs against broad groups of participants in the energy industry. Some of these proceedings involve substantial amounts. The Registrants regularly analyze current information and, as necessary, provide accruals for probable and reasonably estimable liabilities on the eventual disposition of these matters. The Registrants do not expect the disposition of these matters to have a material adverse effect on the Registrants’ financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.(17)  Earnings Per Share (CenterPoint Energy) The following table reconciles numerators and denominators of CenterPoint Energy’s basic and diluted earnings per common share. Basic earnings per common share is determined by dividing Income available to common shareholders - basic by the Weighted average common shares outstanding - basic for the applicable period. Diluted earnings per common share is determined by the inclusion of potentially dilutive common stock equivalent shares that may occur if securities to issue Common Stock were exercised or converted into Common Stock.\\xa0For the Year Ended December\\xa031,\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017\\xa0(in millions, except per share and share amounts)Numerator:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Income available to common shareholders - basic (1)$674\\xa0$333\\xa0$1,792Add back: Series B Preferred Stock dividend (2)—\\xa0—\\xa0—Income available to common shareholders - diluted (1)$674\\xa0$333\\xa0$1,792\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Denominator:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Weighted average common shares outstanding - basic502,050,000\\xa0448,829,000\\xa0430,964,000Plus: Incremental shares from assumed conversions:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Restricted stock (3)3,107,000\\xa03,636,000\\xa03,344,000Series B Preferred Stock\\xa0(2)—\\xa0—\\xa0—Weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted505,157,000\\xa0452,465,000\\xa0434,308,000\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Earnings per common share:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Basic earnings per common share$1.34\\xa0$0.74\\xa0$4.16Diluted earnings per common share$1.33\\xa0$0.74\\xa0$4.13(1)Income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes net income from businesses acquired in the Merger of $190 million.  See Note 4. Income available to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes a reduction in income tax expense of $1,113 million due to tax reform. See Note 15 for further discussion of the impacts of the TCJA.(2)The potentially dilutive impact from Series B Preferred Stock applies the if-converted method in calculating diluted earnings per common share. Under this method, diluted earnings per common share is adjusted for the more dilutive effect of the Series B Preferred Stock as a result of either its accumulated dividend for the period in the numerator or the assumed-converted common share equivalent in the denominator. The computation of diluted earnings per common share outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 excludes Series B Stock Dividends of $68\\xa0million and $17 million, respectively, and 34,354,000  and  8,885,000 potentially dilutive shares, respectively, because to include them would be anti-dilutive. However, these shares could be potentially dilutive in the future.(3)The potentially dilutive impact from restricted stock awards applies the treasury stock method. Under this method, an increase in the average fair market value of Common Stock can result in a greater dilutive impact from these securities.193(18)  Unaudited Quarterly Information Summarized quarterly financial data is as follows:\\xa0Year Ended December 31, 2019\\xa0FirstQuarter\\xa0SecondQuarter\\xa0ThirdQuarter\\xa0FourthQuarter \\xa0(in millions, except per share amounts)CenterPoint Energy\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Revenues$3,531\\xa0$2,798\\xa0$2,742\\xa0$3,230Operating income245\\xa0287\\xa0392\\xa0302Income available to common shareholders140\\xa0165\\xa0241\\xa0128Basic earnings per common share (1)0.28\\xa00.33\\xa00.48\\xa00.25Diluted earnings per common share (1)0.28\\xa00.33\\xa00.47\\xa00.25Houston Electric\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Revenues686\\xa0765\\xa0859\\xa0680Operating income81\\xa0169\\xa0269\\xa099Net income\\xa027\\xa0100\\xa0185\\xa044CERC\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Revenues2,368\\xa01,342\\xa01,126\\xa01,734Operating income 196\\xa058\\xa023\\xa073Net income (loss)138\\xa028\\xa0(7)\\xa053\\xa0Year Ended December 31, 2018\\xa0FirstQuarter\\xa0SecondQuarter \\xa0ThirdQuarter\\xa0FourthQuarter\\xa0(in millions, except per share amounts)CenterPoint Energy\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Revenues$3,155\\xa0$2,186\\xa0$2,212\\xa0$3,036Operating income251\\xa0187\\xa0226\\xa0167Income (loss) available to common shareholders165\\xa0(75)\\xa0153\\xa090Basic earnings (loss) per common share (1)0.38\\xa0(0.17)\\xa00.35\\xa00.18Diluted earnings (loss) per common share (1)0.38\\xa0(0.17)\\xa00.35\\xa00.18Houston Electric\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Revenues755\\xa0854\\xa0897\\xa0728Operating income119\\xa0181\\xa0227\\xa098Net income52\\xa0101\\xa0143\\xa040CERC (2)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Revenues2,400\\xa01,328\\xa01,312\\xa02,303Operating income (loss)131\\xa022\\xa0(7)\\xa076Income (loss) from continuing operations78\\xa0(8)\\xa0(35)\\xa035Income (loss) from discontinued operations52\\xa044\\xa044\\xa0(2)Net income130\\xa036\\xa09\\xa033(1)Quarterly earnings (loss) per common share are based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the quarter, and the sum of the quarters may not equal annual earnings (loss) per common share.(2)Amounts have been recast to reflect discontinued operations in all periods presented.194(19)  Reportable Segments The Registrants’ determination of reportable segments considers the strategic operating units under which the Registrants manage sales, allocate resources and assess performance of various products and services to wholesale or retail customers in differing regulatory environments. The Registrants use operating income as the measure of profit or loss for the reportable segments other than Midstream Investments, where equity in earnings is used.As of December\\xa031, 2019, reportable segments by Registrant are as follows:Registrants\\xa0Houston Electric T&D \\xa0Indiana Electric Integrated\\xa0Natural Gas Distribution \\xa0Energy Services\\xa0Infrastructure Services\\xa0Midstream Investments \\xa0Corporate and OtherCenterPoint Energy\\xa0X\\xa0X\\xa0X\\xa0X\\xa0X\\xa0X\\xa0XHouston Electric\\xa0X\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0CERC\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0X\\xa0X\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0X•CenterPoint Energy’s and Houston Electric’s Houston Electric T&D reportable segment consists of electric transmission and distribution services in the Texas Gulf Coast area.•CenterPoint Energy’s Indiana Electric Integrated reportable segment consists of electric transmission and distribution services primarily to southwestern Indiana and includes power generation and wholesale power operations.•CenterPoint Energy’s Natural Gas Distribution reportable segment consists of intrastate natural gas sales to, and natural gas transportation and distribution for residential, commercial, industrial and institutional customers in Arkansas, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas. •CERC’s Natural Gas Distribution reportable segment consists of intrastate natural gas sales to, and natural gas transportation and distribution for residential, commercial, industrial and institutional customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas. •CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Energy Services reportable segment consists of non-rate regulated natural gas sales and services operations.•CenterPoint Energy’s Infrastructure Services reportable segment consists of underground pipeline construction and repair services.•CenterPoint Energy’s Midstream Investments reportable segment consists of the equity investment in Enable (excluding the Enable Series A Preferred Units).•CenterPoint Energy’s Corporate and Other reportable segment consists of energy performance contracting and sustainable infrastructure services through ESG and other corporate operations which support all of the business operations of CenterPoint Energy.•CERC’s Corporate and Other reportable segment consists primarily of corporate operations which support all of the business operations of CERC.

Funding needs are aggregated and external borrowing or investing is based on the net cash position. The net funding requirements of the money pool are expected to be met with borrowings under CenterPoint Energy’s revolving credit facility or the sale of CenterPoint Energy’s commercial paper.\\xa0The table below summarizes money pool activity:\\xa0December\\xa031, 2019\\xa0December\\xa031, 2018\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0(in millions)Money pool investments (borrowings) (1)$481\\xa0$—\\xa0$(1)\\xa0$114Weighted average interest rate1.98%\\xa01.98%\\xa02.42%\\xa02.42%(1)Included in Accounts and notes receivable (payable)–affiliated companies in Houston Electric’s and CERC’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.Houston Electric and CERC affiliate-related net interest income (expense) were as follows:\\xa0Year Ended December 31,\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0(in millions)Interest income (expense), net (1)$18\\xa0$4\\xa0$1\\xa0$—\\xa0$2\\xa0$—(1)Interest income is included in Other, net and interest expense is included in Interest and other finance charges on Houston Electric’s and CERC’s respective Statements of Consolidated Income.199CenterPoint Energy provides some corporate services to Houston Electric and CERC. The costs of services have been charged directly to Houston Electric and CERC using methods that management believes are reasonable. These methods include negotiated usage rates, dedicated asset assignment and proportionate corporate formulas based on operating expenses, assets, gross margin, employees and a composite of assets, gross margin and employees. Houston Electric provides certain services to CERC. These services are billed at actual cost, either directly or as an allocation and include fleet services, shop services, geographic services, surveying and right-of-way services, radio communications, data circuit management and field operations. Additionally, CERC provides certain services to Houston Electric. These services are billed at actual cost, either directly or as an allocation and include line locating and other miscellaneous services. These charges are not necessarily indicative of what would have been incurred had Houston Electric and CERC not been affiliates. Infrastructure Services provides pipeline construction and repair services to CERC’s NGD. Additionally, CERC, through its subsidiary CES, sells natural gas to Indiana Electric for use in electric generation activities. Amounts charged for these services are included primarily in Operation and maintenance expenses and amounts billed for natural gas sales are included in Non-utility revenues were as follows:\\xa0Year Ended December 31,\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0(in millions)Corporate service charges$177\\xa0$141\\xa0$190\\xa0$147\\xa0$188\\xa0$128Net affiliate service charges (billings)(8)\\xa08\\xa0(17)\\xa017\\xa0(9)\\xa09Pipeline construction and repair service charges (1)—\\xa04\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0—Natural gas sales (2)—\\xa01\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa0—(1)Represents charges from Infrastructure Services to CERC’s NGD for the period February 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019.(2)Represents sales to Indiana Electric from CES for the period February 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019.The table below presents transactions among Houston Electric, CERC and their parent, Utility Holding.\\xa0Year Ended December 31,\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0(in millions)Cash dividends paid to parent$376\\xa0$120\\xa0$209\\xa0$360\\xa0$180\\xa0$601Cash contribution from parent 590\\xa0129\\xa0200\\xa0960\\xa0—\\xa038Capital distribution to parent associated with the Internal Spin (1)—\\xa028\\xa0—\\xa01,473\\xa0—\\xa0—(1)The capital distribution in 2019 associated with the Internal Spin is a result of the return to accrual for the periods of CERC’s ownership during 2018.(22) Leases The Registrants adopted ASC 842, Leases, and all related amendments on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method and elected not to recast comparative periods in the year of adoption as permitted by the standard. There was no adjustment to retained earnings as a result of transition. As a result, disclosures for periods prior to adoption will be presented in accordance with accounting standards in effect for those periods. The Registrants also elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allowed them to carry forward the historical lease classification. Additionally, the Registrants elected the practical expedient related to land easements, which allows the carry forward of the accounting treatment for land easements on existing agreements. The total ROU assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities upon adoption were $30 million, $1 million and $27 million for CenterPoint Energy, Houston Electric and CERC, respectively. The Merger was completed on February 1, 2019, and as such the amounts recorded upon adoption are exclusive of Vectren’s leases.200An arrangement is determined to be a lease at inception based on whether the Registrant has the right to control the use of an identified asset. ROU assets represent the Registrants’ right to use the underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Registrants’ obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term, including payments at commencement that depend on an index or rate. Most leases in which the Registrants are the lessee do not have a readily determinable implicit rate, so an incremental borrowing rate, based on the information available at the lease commencement date, is utilized to determine the present value of lease payments. When a secured borrowing rate is not readily available, unsecured borrowing rates are adjusted for the effects of collateral to determine the incremental borrowing rate. Each Registrant uses the implicit rate for agreements in which it is a lessor. Lease expense and lease income are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term for operating leases. The Registrants have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components and have elected the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components for certain classes of leases, such as office buildings. For classes of leases in which lease and non-lease components are not combined, consideration is allocated between components based on the stand-alone prices. Sublease income is not significant to the Registrants.The Registrants’ lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees, material restrictions or material covenants. There are no material lease transactions with related parties. Agreements in which the Registrants are lessors do not include provisions for the lessee to purchase the assets. Because risk is minimal, the Registrants do not take any significant actions to manage risk associated with the residual value of their leased assets.The Registrants’ lease agreements are primarily equipment and real property leases, including land and office facility leases. The Registrants’ lease terms may include options to extend or terminate a lease when it is reasonably certain that those options will be exercised. Operating lease payments exclude approximately $16 million of legally-binding undiscounted minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced. The Registrants have elected an accounting policy that exempts leases with terms of one year or less from the recognition requirements of ASC 842. The components of lease cost, included in Operation and maintenance expense on the Registrants’ respective Statements of Consolidated Income, are as follows:\\xa0Year Ended December 31, 2019\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0(in millions)Operating lease cost$25\\xa0$—\\xa0$5Short-term lease cost75\\xa023\\xa0—Variable lease cost1\\xa0—\\xa01Total lease cost$101\\xa0$23\\xa0$6The components of lease income were as follows:\\xa0Year Ended December 31, 2019\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0(in millions)Operating lease income$4\\xa0$2\\xa0$1Variable lease income2\\xa0—\\xa0—Total lease income$6\\xa0$2\\xa0$1201Supplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows:\\xa0December 31, 2019\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0(in millions, except lease term and discount rate)Assets:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Operating ROU assets (1)$63\\xa0$1\\xa0$24Total leased assets$63\\xa0$1\\xa0$24Liabilities:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Current operating lease liability (2)$21\\xa0$—\\xa0$4Non-current operating lease liability (3)42\\xa01\\xa020Total leased liabilities$63\\xa0$1\\xa0$24\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Weighted-average remaining lease term (in years) - operating leases5.1\\xa05.2\\xa07.7Weighted-average discount rate - operating leases3.42%\\xa03.52%\\xa03.67%(1)Reported within Other assets in the Registrants’ respective Consolidated Balance Sheets.(2)Reported within Current other liabilities in the Registrants’ respective Consolidated Balance Sheets.(3)Reported within Other liabilities in the Registrants’ respective Consolidated Balance Sheets.As of December\\xa031, 2019, maturities of operating lease liabilities were as follows:\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston\\xa0Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0(in millions)2020$22\\xa0$1\\xa0$6202116\\xa0—\\xa0420229\\xa0—\\xa0420237\\xa0—\\xa0320243\\xa0—\\xa022025 and beyond12\\xa0—\\xa09Total lease payments69\\xa01\\xa028Less: Interest6\\xa0—\\xa04Present value of lease liabilities$63\\xa0$1\\xa0$24The following table sets forth information concerning the Registrants’ obligations under non-cancelable long-term operating leases as of December\\xa031, 2018:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0CenterPoint Energy\\xa0Houston\\xa0Electric\\xa0CERC\\xa0(in millions)2019$6\\xa0$1\\xa0$520206\\xa0—\\xa0520215\\xa0—\\xa0420224\\xa0—\\xa0420233\\xa0—\\xa032024 and beyond12\\xa0—\\xa011Total (1)$36\\xa0$1\\xa0$32(1)The Merger was completed on February 1, 2019.

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Securities Purchase Agreement, PowerTeam Services has agreed to purchase all of the outstanding equity interests of VISCO for approximately $850 million, subject to customary adjustments set forth in the Securities Purchase Agreement, including adjustments based on VISCO’s net working capital at closing, indebtedness, cash and cash equivalents and transaction expenses. Per the Securities Purchase Agreement, VISCO will be converted from a wholly-owned corporation to a limited liability company that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes immediately prior to the closing of the transaction resulting in the sale of membership units at closing.\\xa0 The sale will be considered an asset sale for tax purposes requiring the net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $123 million as of December 31, 2019 to be recognized; therefore, any deferred tax assets and liabilities within the reporting unit are not included in the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities that will be transferred to PowerTeam Services.The completion of the sale is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others (i) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and (ii) customary conditions regarding the accuracy of the representations and warranties and compliance by the parties in all material respects with their respective obligations under the Securities Purchase Agreement. The Securities Purchase Agreement also includes customary termination provisions, including if the closing of the sale has not occurred on or before June 3, 2020. The sale is not subject to a financing condition and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020, subject to satisfaction of the foregoing conditions, among other things.On February18, 2020, CenterPoint Energy received notice from the Federal Trade Commission granting early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act in connection with the proposed sale of Infrastructure Services.Proposed Divestiture of Energy Services (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)On February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reportable segment, to Athena Energy Services. This transaction does not include CEIP and its assets. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Purchase Agreement, Athena Energy Services  has agreed to purchase all of the outstanding equity interests of CES for approximately $400 million, subject to customary adjustments set forth in the Equity Purchase Agreement, including adjustments based on CES’s net working capital at closing, indebtedness and transaction expenses. Per the Equity Purchase Agreement, CES will be converted from a wholly-owned corporation to a limited liability company that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes immediately prior to the closing of the transaction resulting in the sale of membership units at closing. The sale will be considered an asset sale 203for tax purposes requiring the net deferred tax liabilities of approximately $25 million as of December 31, 2019 to be recognized; therefore, any deferred tax assets and liabilities within the reporting unit are not included in the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities that will be transferred to the buyer. The completion of the sale is subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others (i) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and (ii) the conversion of CES to a Delaware limited liability company, (iii) the distribution of the equity interests in CenterPoint Energy Intrastate Pipelines, LLC held by CES to CERC Corp. or its affiliates and (iv) customary conditions regarding the accuracy of the representations and warranties and compliance by the parties in all material respects with their respective obligations under the Equity Purchase Agreement. The Equity Purchase Agreement includes customary termination provisions, including if the closing of the transaction has not occurred on or before June 24, 2020.The sale is not subject to a financing condition and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020, subject to satisfaction of the foregoing conditions, among other things.CenterPoint Energy Dividend Declarations (CenterPoint Energy)Equity Instrument\\xa0Declaration Date\\xa0Record Date\\xa0Payment Date\\xa0Per ShareCommon Stock\\xa0February 3, 2020\\xa0February 20, 2020\\xa0March 12, 2020\\xa0$0.2900Series A Preferred Stock\\xa0February 3, 2020\\xa0February 14, 2020\\xa0March 2, 2020\\xa030.6250Series B Preferred Stock\\xa0February 3, 2020\\xa0February 14, 2020\\xa0March 2, 2020\\xa017.5000Enable Distributions Declarations (CenterPoint Energy)Equity Instrument\\xa0Declaration Date\\xa0Record Date\\xa0Payment Date\\xa0Per Unit Distribution\\xa0Expected Cash Distribution\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(in millions)Enable common units\\xa0February 7, 2020\\xa0February 18, 2020\\xa0February 25, 2020\\xa0$0.3305\\xa0$77Enable Series A Preferred Units\\xa0February 7, 2020\\xa0February 7, 2020\\xa0February 14, 2020\\xa00.6250\\xa09Item 9.Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial DisclosureNone.Item 9A.Controls and ProceduresDisclosure Controls And ProceduresIn accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, the Registrants carried out separate evaluations, under the supervision and with the participation of each company’s management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on those evaluations, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, in each case, concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December\\xa031, 2019 to provide assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.  On the Merger Date, CenterPoint Energy completed the acquisition of Vectren. CenterPoint Energy evaluated the control environment and implemented CenterPoint Energy’s internal control structure over the acquired operations. With the exception of the implementation of the Vectren acquisition into CenterPoint Energy’s control structure, there has been no change in the Registrants’ internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended December\\xa031, 2019 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Registrants’ internal controls over financial reporting.204Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingThe Registrants’ management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule\\xa013a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:•Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;•Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;\\xa0and•Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Management has designed its internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Management’s assessment included review and testing of both the design effectiveness and operating effectiveness of controls over all relevant assertions related to all significant accounts and disclosures in the financial statements.All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Under the supervision and with the participation of the Registrants’ management, including their respective principal executive officers and principal financial officers, the Registrants conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control\\xa0— Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the Registrants’ evaluation under the framework in Internal Control\\xa0— Integrated Framework (2013), the Registrants’ management has concluded, in each case, that their internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December\\xa031, 2019.Deloitte\\xa0& Touche LLP, CenterPoint Energy’s independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of CenterPoint Energy’s internal control over financial reporting as of December\\xa031, 2019 which is set forth below.\\xa0This report is not applicable to Houston Electric or CERC as they are not accelerated or large accelerated filers.205REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Shareholders ofCenterPoint Energy, Inc.Houston, TexasOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\xa0We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\\xa0Houston, TexasFebruary\\xa027, 2020206Item 9B.Other InformationCompensatory Arrangements of Certain OfficersAmendments to Forms of Award Agreements under Long-Term Incentive PlanOn February 18, 2020, the Compensation Committee (“Compensation Committee”) of the Board of Directors of CenterPoint Energy approved new forms of award agreements under CenterPoint Energy’s LTIP for performance awards and restricted stock unit awards. Among other things, the newly approved forms of award agreements for officers and director-level employees provide that a “retirement eligible” (age 55 or greater with at least five years of service) participant, who meets the requirements for enhanced retirement as specified under the agreement will fully vest in the award, subject, in the case of performance awards, to the achievement of the relevant performance metrics. The requirements for enhanced retirement for employees who are not officers subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act include having a sum of age and years of employment equal to 65 or greater, providing at least six months’ written notice of retirement, providing a transition plan, and retiring on or after the January 1 immediately following the grant (for restricted stock units) or the first anniversary of the beginning of the designated performance cycle (for performance awards). For officers subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, the requirements for enhanced retirement include having a sum of age and years of employment equal to 65 or greater, providing a transition plan, providing reasonable advanced written notice of retirement (as determined by the Compensation Committee), and retiring on or after the January 1 immediately following the grant (for restricted stock units) or the first anniversary of the beginning of the designated performance cycle (for performance awards). In addition, for officers subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, eligibility for enhanced retirement is subject to approval by the Compensation Committee. The newly approved forms of award agreements also provide for pro-rata vesting upon the “sale of subsidiary,” defined as a change in the ownership of a subsidiary, or a substantial portion of the assets of a subsidiary, of CenterPoint Energy, Inc., if the participant is performing services for the subsidiary at the time and ceases employment with CenterPoint Energy upon and in connection with the sale. Amounts vested upon a sale of subsidiary are paid no later than the 70th day after the sale. The description of the forms of award agreements, as amended, is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the forms of performance award and restricted stock unit award agreements, as applicable, which are included as Exhibits 10(q)(2), 10(q)(5) and 10(q)(6) hereto and incorporated by reference herein.Compensatory Arrangements of Certain OfficersAs previously disclosed, on December 9, 2019, Tracy B. Bridge, Executive Vice President and President, Electric Division of CenterPoint Energy, provided notice of his intent to retire from CenterPoint Energy. On February 24, 2020, the Compensation Committee elected to pay Mr. Bridge pursuant to the enhanced retirement provisions under the applicable award agreements under CenterPoint Energy’s LTIP in connection with his retirement from CenterPoint Energy effective as of February 25, 2020, whereby his outstanding awards will fully vest, subject, in the case of performance awards, to the achievement of the relevant performance metrics.On February 26, 2020, the Compensation Committee approved certain compensation arrangements for Milton Carroll, Executive Chairman of CenterPoint Energy, as a result of his increased responsibilities in connection with the previously disclosed resignation of CenterPoint Energy’s President and Chief Executive Officer. Specifically, his increased responsibilities include facilitating the identification, selection and transition of a new President and Chief Executive Officer of CenterPoint Energy. In addition to his base salary of $820,000, effective as of April 1, 2020, and long-term incentive compensation target of 325% of base salary, Mr. Carroll will receive (i) a fully-vested equity award with a value at grant equal to $1,500,000, to be granted upon the appointment of a new President and Chief Executive Officer of CenterPoint Energy, with one-third of the underlying shares to be paid upon the grant date, another one-third to be paid upon the first anniversary of the grant date, and the remaining one-third to be paid on the second anniversary of the grant date; provided, however, if Mr. Carroll earlier separates from CenterPoint Energy such that he is neither an employee nor director, any remaining unpaid shares under the award will be payable upon his separation, and (ii) a $500,000 bonus for services rendered in 2019 in connection with CenterPoint Energy’s strategic initiatives.

The terms “Royal Caribbean International,” “Celebrity Cruises,” “Azamara” and “Silversea Cruises” refer to our wholly- or majority-owned global cruise brands. Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we also refer to regional brands in which we hold an ownership interest, including “TUI Cruises,” and “Pullmantur.” However, because these regional brands are unconsolidated investments, our operating results and other disclosures herein do not include these brands unless otherwise specified.  In accordance with cruise vacation industry practice, the term “berths” is determined based on double occupancy per cabin even though many cabins can accommodate three or more passengers.This Annual Report on Form 10-K also includes trademarks, trade names and service marks of other companies. Use or display by us of other parties’ trademarks, trade names or service marks is not intended to and does not imply a relationship with, or endorsement or sponsorship of us by, these other parties other than as described herein.1Table of Contents Item 1. Business. GeneralWe are the world\\'s second largest cruise company. We control and operate four global cruise brands: Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, Azamara and Silversea Cruises (collectively, our \"Global Brands\"). We also own a 50% joint venture interest in the German brand TUI Cruises and a 49% interest in the Spanish brand Pullmantur (collectively, our \"Partner Brands\"). Together, our Global Brands and our Partner Brands operate a combined total of 61 ships in the cruise vacation industry with an aggregate capacity of approximately 141,570 berths as of December\\xa031, 2019. Our ships operate on a selection of worldwide itineraries that call on more than 1,000 destinations on all seven continents. In addition to our headquarters in Miami, Florida, we have offices and a network of international representatives around the world, which primarily focus on sales and market development.We compete principally by operating valued brands that offer exceptional service provided by our crew and on the basis of innovation and quality of ships, variety of itineraries, choice of destinations and price. We believe that our commitment to build state-of-the-art ships and to invest in the maintenance and upgrade of our fleet to, among other things, incorporate many of our latest signature innovations, allows us to continue to attract new and loyal repeat guests.We believe cruising continues to be a popular vacation choice due to its inherent value, extensive itineraries and variety of shipboard and shoreside activities. In addition, we believe our brands are well-positioned globally and possess the ability to attract a wide range of guests by appealing to multiple customer bases allowing our global sourcing to be well diversified. Royal Caribbean was founded in 1968 as a partnership. Its corporate structure has evolved over the years and, the current parent corporation, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., was incorporated on July 23, 1985 in the Republic of Liberia under the Business Corporation Act of Liberia.Our Global BrandsOur Global Brands include Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, Azamara, and Silversea Cruises. We believe our Global Brands possess the versatility to enter multiple cruise market segments within the cruise vacation industry. Although each of our Global Brands has its own marketing style, as well as ships and crews of various sizes, the nature of the products sold and services delivered by our Global Brands share a common base (i.e., the sale and provision of cruise vacations). Our Global Brands also have similar itineraries as well as similar cost and revenue components. In addition, our Global Brands source passengers from similar markets around the world and operate in similar economic environments with a significant degree of commercial overlap. As a result, we strategically manage our Global Brands as a single business with the ultimate objective of maximizing long-term shareholder value. Royal Caribbean InternationalRoyal Caribbean International is positioned to compete in both the contemporary and premium segments of the cruise vacation industry. The brand appeals to families with children of all ages, as well as both older and younger couples, providing cruises that generally feature a casual ambiance, as well as a variety of activities and entertainment venues. We believe that the quality of the Royal Caribbean International brand allows it to achieve market coverage that is among the broadest of any of the major cruise brands in the cruise vacation industry. Royal Caribbean International’s strategy is to attract an array of vacationing guests by providing a wide variety of itineraries to destinations worldwide, including Alaska, Asia, Australia, Bahamas, Bermuda, Canada, the Caribbean, Europe, the Panama Canal and New Zealand, with cruise lengths ranging from two to 19 nights. Royal Caribbean International offers multiple innovative options for onboard dining, entertainment and other onboard activities. Because of the brand’s ability to deliver extensive and innovative product offerings at an excellent value to consumers, we believe Royal Caribbean International is well positioned to attract new consumers to cruising and to continue to bring loyal repeat guests back for their next vacation. 2Table of ContentsRoyal Caribbean International operates 26 ships with an aggregate capacity of approximately 87,150 berths, including the brand\\'s newest ship, Spectrum of the Seas, which entered service in April 2019.

The up-market segment incorporates elements of the premium segment and the luxury segment, which is generally characterized by smaller ships, high standards of accommodation and service and exotic itineraries. Azamara\\'s strategy is to deliver distinctive destination experiences through unique itineraries with more overnights and longer stays as well as comprehensive tours allowing guests to experience the destination in more depth. These destination experiences include over 1,700 pre and post-voyage land programs.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further details.3Table of ContentsTUI CruisesTUI Cruises is a joint venture owned 50% by us and 50% by TUI AG, a German tourism company, which is designed to serve the contemporary and premium segments of the German cruise market by offering a product tailored for German guests. All onboard activities, services, shore excursions and menu offerings are designed to suit the preferences of this target market. TUI Cruises operates seven ships, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 17,600 berths as of December\\xa031, 2019, including the brand\\'s newest ship, Mein Schiff 2, which entered service in January 2019.

On February 7, 2020, TUI Cruises entered into an agreement to acquire Hapag-Lloyd Cruises, a luxury and expedition brand for German-speaking guests, from TUI AG. Hapag-Lloyd Cruises operates two luxury liners and three smaller expedition ships. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. PullmanturThe Pullmantur brand is a joint venture owned 49% by us and 51% by Cruises Investment Holdings S.A., an affiliate of Springwater Capital LLC. Pullmantur operates in the contemporary segment of the Spanish and Latin American cruise markets and is designed to attract Spanish-speaking families and couples and includes Spanish-speaking crew, as well as tailored food and entertainment options. The three ships operated by Pullmantur have an aggregate capacity of approximately 6,050 berths. Zenith was sold to a third party in January 2020. To offset the decrease in capacity to the Pullmantur brand, commencing in the second quarter of 2021, we expect to charter Grandeur of the Seas to Pullmantur.Industry Cruising is considered a well-established vacation sector in the North American, European and Australian  markets and a developing sector in several other emerging markets. Industry data indicates that market penetration rates are still low and that a significant portion of cruise guests carried are first-time cruisers. We believe this presents an opportunity for long-term growth and a potential for increased profitability. The following table details industry market penetration rates for North America, Europe and Asia/Pacific computed based on the number of annual cruise guests as a percentage of the total population:YearNorth America(1)(2)Europe(1)(3)Asia/Pacific(1)(4)20153.36%\\xa0\\xa01.25%\\xa0\\xa00.08%\\xa0\\xa020163.43%\\xa0\\xa01.23%\\xa0\\xa00.11%\\xa0\\xa020173.56%\\xa0\\xa01.28%\\xa0\\xa00.15%\\xa0\\xa020183.87%\\xa0\\xa01.38%\\xa0\\xa00.16%\\xa0\\xa020193.89%\\xa0\\xa01.41%\\xa0\\xa00.20%\\xa0\\xa0___________________________________________________________________(1)Source: Our estimates are based on a combination of data obtained from publicly available sources including the International Monetary Fund, United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Cruise Lines International Association (\"CLIA\") and G.P.

(4)Our estimates include Southeast Asia (most notably: Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines), East Asia (most notably: China and Japan), South Asia (most notably: India) and Oceania (most notably: Australia and New Zealand) regions.We estimate that the global cruise fleet was served by a weighted average of approximately 579,000 berths during 2019 with approximately 354 ships at the end of 2019. As of December\\xa031, 2019, there were approximately 4Table of Contents67 ships with an estimated 159,000 berths that are expected to be placed in service in the global cruise market through 2024, although it is also possible that ships could be ordered or taken out of service during these periods. We estimate that the global cruise industry carried approximately 30.0 million cruise guests in 2019 compared to approximately 28.5 million cruise guests carried in 2018 and approximately 26.7 million cruise guests carried in 2017.

The compound annual growth rate in cruise guests sourced from this market was approximately 4% from 2015 to 2019.EuropeIndustry cruise guests sourced from Europe represented approximately 25% of global cruise guests in 2019. The compound annual growth rate in cruise guests sourced from this market was approximately 3% from 2015 to 2019.Asia/PacificIndustry cruise guests sourced from the Asia/Pacific region represented approximately 24% of global cruise guests in 2019. The compound annual growth rate in cruise guests sourced from this market was approximately 24% from 2015 to 2019. The recent coronavirus outbreak and the resulting measures taken by China and other countries to move aggressively to contain the disease, including travel restrictions, have resulted in the cancellation of several of our cruises in Southeast Asia and modification of several itineraries in the region. In addition, we have imposed several measures to protect our guests and crew, including denying boarding to those that have traveled from, to or through mainland China or Hong Kong. See Outlook for further discussion.5Table of ContentsCompetitionWe compete with a number of cruise lines. Our principal competitors are Carnival Corporation & plc, which owns, among others, Aida Cruises, Carnival Cruise Line, Costa Cruises, Cunard Line, Holland America Line, P&O Cruises, Princess Cruises and Seabourn; Disney Cruise Line; MSC Cruises; and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd, which owns Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises. Cruise lines also compete with other vacation alternatives such as land-based resort hotels, Internet-based alternative lodging sites and sightseeing destinations for consumers’ leisure time. Interest for such activities is influenced by political and general economic conditions. Companies within the vacation market are dependent on consumer discretionary spending.Operating StrategiesOur strategic emphasis on People, Profits and Planet has led us to focus on the following principal operating strategies:•Protect the health, safety and security of our guests and employees, •protect the environment in which our vessels and organization operate, •invest in our workforce in order to better serve our global guest base and grow our business, and promote gender equality, diversity and inclusion,•strengthen our consumer engagement in order to enhance our revenues, •increase the awareness and market penetration of our brands globally,•focus on cost efficiency, manage our operating expenditures and ensure adequate cash and liquidity, with the overall goal of maximizing our return on invested capital and long-term shareholder value,•strategically invest in our fleet through the upgrade and maintenance of existing ships and the transfer of key innovations, while prudently expanding our fleet with new state-of-the-art cruise ships,•capitalize on the portability and flexibility of our ships by deploying them into those markets and itineraries that provide opportunities to optimize returns, while continuing our focus on existing key markets,•provide extraordinary destination experiences and state-of-the-art port facilities to our guests,•continue to integrate digital technological capabilities, data analytics and artificial intelligence into our operations to service customer preferences and expectations in an innovative manner, create efficiencies and enhance employee satisfaction, and •maintain strong relationships with travel agencies, which continue to be the principal industry distribution channel, while enhancing our consumer outreach programs.Safety and health policiesWe are committed to protecting the health, safety and security of our guests, employees and others working on our behalf. Our efforts in these areas are managed by our dedicated Safety, Security, Environment, Medical and Public Health Department which is responsible for all of our maritime safety, global security, environmental stewardship and medical/public health activities; overseen by the Safety, Environment and Health Committee of our board of directors and informed by a Maritime Advisory Board of experts. Protect the environment We are focused on the environmental health of the marine environment and communities in which we operate. This includes reducing our carbon footprint through the energy and carbon efficiencies included in the design of our new capacity, our ongoing energy management program on our existing fleet and the development of new technologies.6Table of ContentsOur long-term partnership with the World Wildlife Fund focuses on greenhouse gas reduction strategies, sustainable food supplies, sustainable destinations and guest education on ocean conservation issues, including climate change, which supports onboard conservation efforts such as our reduced use of plastics and increased sourcing of sustainable seafood. We are also committed to water quality and management projects onboard and in the communities in which we operate.We believe in transparent reporting on our environmental and sustainability stewardship, as well as our corporate governance efforts, and annually publish a Sustainability Report. This report, which is accessible on our corporate website, highlights our progress with regards to those environmental and social aspects of our business that we believe are most significant to our organization and stakeholders. In addition to providing an overview, the report complies with the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative to ensure the report is as complete and accurate as possible. Our corporate website also provides information about our environmental performance goals and sustainability initiatives. The foregoing information contained on our website is not part of any of these reports and is not incorporated by reference herein or in any other report or document we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Investing in our workforce and promoting gender equality, diversity and inclusionWe believe that our employees, both shipboard and shoreside, are a critical success factor for our business. We strive to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain the best employees, who provide our guests with extraordinary vacations. Our ability to attract, engage, and retain key employees has been and will remain critical to our success. We focus on providing our employees with a competitive compensation structure, development opportunities, and other personal and professional growth opportunities in order to strengthen and support our human capital. We also select, develop and have strategies to retain high performing leaders to advance the enterprise now and in the future. To that end, we pay special attention to identifying high performing potential leaders and developing bench strength so these leaders can assume leadership roles throughout the organization. We strive to maintain a work environment that reinforces collaboration, motivation and innovation, and believe that maintaining a strong employee-focused culture is beneficial to the growth and expansion of our business. We support the equal representation of women in all levels. We foster diversity and inclusion among our broad employee base. Consumer engagementWe place a strong focus on identifying the needs of our guests and creating product features and innovations that our customers value. We are focused on targeting high-value guests by better understanding consumer data and insights to create communication strategies that resonate with our target audiences. We target customers across all touch points and identify underlying needs for which guests are willing to pay a premium. We rely on various programs and technologies during the cruise-planning, cruising and after-cruise periods aimed at increasing ticket prices, onboard revenues and occupancy. We have and continue to strategically invest in onboard projects on our ships that we believe drive marketability, profitability and improve the guest experience.Global awareness and market penetration We increase brand awareness and market penetration of our cruise brands in various ways, including the use of communication strategies and marketing campaigns designed to emphasize the qualities of each brand and to broaden the awareness of the brand, especially among target groups. Our marketing strategies include the use of travel agencies, traditional media, mobile and digital media as well as social media, influencers and brand websites. Our brands engage past and potential guests by collaborating with travel partners and through call centers, international offices and international representatives. In addition, our Global Brands target repeat guests with exclusive benefits offered through their respective loyalty programs.We sell and market our Global Brands, Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, Azamara and Silversea Cruises, to guests outside of the United States and Canada through the combined efforts of internationally focused internal resources and a network of approximately 80 independent international representatives located throughout the world covering more than 183 countries. Historically, our focus has been to primarily source guests 7Table of Contentsfor our Global Brands from North America. We continue to expand our focus on selling and marketing our cruise brands to guests in countries outside of North America by tailoring itineraries and onboard product offerings to the cultural characteristics and preferences of our international guests. In addition, we explore opportunities that may arise to acquire or develop brands tailored to specific markets. Passenger ticket revenues generated by sales originating in countries outside of the United States were approximately 38% of total passenger ticket revenues in 2019, 39% in 2018 and 41% in 2017. International guests have grown from approximately 2.5 million in 2015 to approximately 2.6 million in 2019. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - “Conducting business globally may result in increased costs and other risks” for a discussion of the risks associated with our international operations.Cost efficiency, operating expenditures and adequate cash and liquidity We have adopted a number of strategies to control our operating costs and will continue to do so in 2020. For example, we have adopted numerous initiatives to reduce energy consumption and, by extension, fuel costs. These include the design of more energy-efficient ships as well as the implementation of more efficient hardware, including improvements in operations and voyage planning as well as improvements to the propulsion, machinery, HVAC and lighting systems. The overall impact of these efforts has resulted in an approximate 35% improvement in energy efficiency from 2005 through 2019 and we believe that our energy consumption per guest is currently the lowest in the cruise industry. In order to sustain our competitive advantage, we will continue to seek to lead with innovative technologies and commit to achieve our short and long-term sustainability goals. We are focused on maintaining a strong liquidity position, investment grade credit metrics and a balanced debt maturity profile. We believe these strategies enhance our ability to achieve our overall goal of maximizing our long-term shareholder value. Fleet upgrade, maintenance and expansionWe place a strong focus on innovation, which we seek to achieve by introducing new concepts on our new ships and continuously making improvements to our fleet through modernization projects. Several of these innovations have become signature elements of our brands. For the Royal Caribbean International brand, we introduced the “Royal Promenade” (a boulevard with shopping, dining and entertainment venues) and interior balconies on the Oasis class ships and a two-level family suite on Symphony of the Seas. For the Celebrity Cruises brand, we enhanced many of the brand\\'s design features through the introduction of the Solstice class ships. More recently, with the introduction of Celebrity Edge, we introduced the \"Magic Carpet\" (a cantilevered, floating platform that reaches a height of 13 stories above sea level and can serve as a dining venue, full bar and platform for live music) and newly designed staterooms with an \"Infinite Veranda\" where, with the touch of a button, the veranda becomes part of the entire living space.In 2018, the Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity Cruises brands announced the \"Royal Amplified\" and \"Celebrity Revolution\" modernization programs to upgrade vessels across their fleet. As part of these modernization programs, we incorporate certain innovations included in our newer ships to some of the ships in the remaining fleet. The process of integrating some of our latest innovations into our older vessels allows us to create a greater level of consistency of product across our fleet.As part of the newbuild and modernization programs, we also seek to bring innovations in the areas of safety, reliability and energy efficiency to our fleet.We are committed to building state-of-the-art ships at a moderate growth rate and we believe our success in this area provides us with a competitive advantage. Our newer vessels traditionally generate higher revenue yield premiums and are more efficient to operate than older vessels. As of December 31, 2019, our Global Brands and Partner Brands have 17 ships on order. Refer to the Operations section below for further information on our ships on order. In addition, we regularly evaluate opportunities to order new ships, purchase existing ships or sell ships in our current fleet while ensuring that we remain focused on the returns we generate on invested capital and maintaining a high level of discipline on capital spending and operating leverage. In the current environment of high industry 8Table of Contentsdemand, we have placed new ship orders earlier than we have historically done as well as more aggressively sought to sell older capacity.Markets and itinerariesIn an effort to penetrate untapped markets, diversify our consumer base and respond to changing economic and geopolitical market conditions, we continue to seek opportunities to deploy ships to new and stronger markets and itineraries throughout the world. The portability of our ships allows us to deploy our ships to meet demand within our existing cruise markets. We make deployment decisions generally 18 to 28 months in advance, with the goal of optimizing the overall profitability of our portfolio. Additionally, the infrastructure investments we have made to create a flexible global sourcing model have made our brands relevant in a number of markets around the world, which allows us to be opportunistic and source the highest yielding guests for our itineraries.Our ships offer a wide selection of itineraries that call on more than 1,000 destinations in 126 countries, spanning all seven continents. We are focused on obtaining the best possible long-term shareholder returns by operating in established markets while growing our presence in developing markets. New capacity allows us to expand into new markets and itineraries. Our brands have expanded their mix of itineraries while strengthening our ability to further penetrate the Asian and Australian markets. The acquisition of Silversea Cruises added more than 500 new destinations allowing us to expand and enhance our selection of exotic itineraries.Destination experiences and port facilitiesAdditionally, in order to provide unique destination experiences to our guests, we are investing in our private land destinations. For instance, in 2018, we announced Perfect Day Island Collection, an initiative to develop a series of private island destinations around the world. The first island in the collection, Perfect Day at CocoCay, opened in Spring 2019 and includes a wide range of attractions, such as a water park, zip line and wave and freshwater pool. The second island in the collection, Perfect Day at Lelepa, is scheduled to open in 2022 and will offer its own unique experience. In 2019, we also announced the launch of a Royal Beach Club initiative to bring the unique features and cultures of each destination to life. The first will be Royal Beach Club in Antigua, launching 2021.In an effort to secure desirable berthing facilities for our ships, and to provide new or enhanced cruise destinations for our guests, we actively assist or invest in the development or enhancement of certain port facilities and infrastructure, including mixed-use commercial properties, located in strategic ports of call. For instance, a new homeport cruise terminal of approximately 170,000 square feet was completed at PortMiami in Miami, Florida in 2018 and we are building a new homeport cruise terminal in Galveston, Texas of approximately 140,000 square feet to be completed in 2021.Generally, we collaborate with local, private or governmental entities by providing management and/or financial assistance and often enter into long-term port usage arrangements. Our participation in these efforts is generally accomplished via investments with the relevant government authority and/or various other strategic partnerships established to develop and/or operate the port facilities, by providing direct development and management expertise or in certain limited circumstances, by providing direct or indirect financial support. In exchange for our involvement, we generally secure preferential berthing rights for our ships. Technological capabilities Technology is a pervasive part of virtually every business process we use to support our strategic focus and provide a quality experience to our customers before, during and after their cruise. In past years, we have continued to integrate digital capabilities into our operations and have increased our focus in bringing in data analytics and artificial intelligence into our processes. For example, we have continued the deployment of our innovative guest journey solutions across our fleet from online check-in to port embarkation to onboard cruise experience. At the same time, we are investing in shipboard operational technology to facilitate casino play, hotel maintenance, as well as the optimization of marine maintenance. In concert with our destination focus, our island technology solutions are now enabling our guests to remain connected with WiFi access, order food and beverage as well as take advantage of all the island based activities with the same ease as onboard our ships.9Table of ContentsInvestments in our core platforms, as well as the trade and direct distribution channels, are delivering the benefit of more modernized solutions with scalability and faster self-service response times while also deploying new features such as flight packages and additional promotional offer capabilities.Cyber security and data privacy are an ongoing focus, and we have made and will continue to make investments to protect our customer data, intellectual property and global operations. Travel agency support and consumer outreachTravel agencies continue to be the primary source of ticket sales for our ships. We believe in the value of this distribution channel and invest in maintaining strong relationships with our travel partners. To accomplish this goal, we seek to ensure that our commission rates and incentive structures remain competitive with the marketplace. We continuously work with travel agencies to sell upgrades and add-ons such as air and pre-cruise purchases to improve the retention and profitability of the channel. We provide brand dedicated sales representatives who serve as consultants to our travel partners. We also provide trained customer service representatives, call centers and online training tools. In addition, we continue to operate our Consumer Outreach department, which provides consumers 24-hour access to our vacation planners and customer service agents in our call centers. In addition, we maintain and invest in our websites, including mobile applications and mobile websites. We enable our guests to communicate and book with us through various channels such as phone, web, chat, text message, and/or email. We also have a robust Onboard Cruise Sales department to help guests to book their next cruise vacations while onboard our ships. Guest ServicesWe offer to handle virtually all travel aspects related to guest reservations and transportation, including arranging guest pre- and post-hotel stay arrangements and air transportation. Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, Azamara and Silversea Cruises offer recognition and status upgrades to their guests through their loyalty programs, Crown & Anchor Society, Captain’s Club, Le Club Voyage and Venetian Society, respectively, to encourage repeat business. Crown & Anchor Society has approximately 16 million members worldwide. Captain’s Club, Le Club Voyage and Venetian Society have approximately 4.8 million members combined worldwide. Members are recognized through increasing membership status by accumulating cruise points or credits, depending on the brand, which may be redeemed on future sailings. Members are awarded points or credits in proportion to the number of cruise days and stateroom category. The loyalty programs provide tiers of membership benefits which entitle guests to upgraded experiences and recognition relative to the status achieved once the guests have accumulated the number of cruise points or credits specified for each tier.

Demand is strongest for cruises during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer months and holidays. In order to mitigate the impact of the winter weather in the Northern Hemisphere and to capitalize on the summer season in the Southern Hemisphere, our brands have focused on deployment in the Caribbean, Asia and Australia during that period.Passengers and CapacitySelected statistical information is shown in the following table (see Financial Presentation- Description of Certain Line Items and Selected Operational and Financial Metrics under Item 7.

Refer to Note 1. General and Note 3. Business Combination to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on the three-month reporting lag and the Silversea Cruises acquisition. (2)\\xa0We acquired Silversea Cruises on July 31, 2018 and report their results on a three-month reporting lag. As a result, these amounts include only August and September 2018 amounts for Silversea Cruises. Refer to Note 1. General and Note 3. Business Combination to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on the three-month reporting lag and the Silversea Cruises acquisition.(3)\\xa0These amounts do not include November and December 2015 amounts for Pullmantur as the net Pullmantur result for those months was included within Other expense in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December\\xa031, 2016, as a result of the elimination of the Pullmantur two-month reporting lag, and did not affect Gross Yields, Net Yields, Gross Cruise Costs, Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel. Additionally, effective August 2016, following the sale of our 51% interest in Pullmantur Holdings, we no longer include Pullmantur in these amounts.Cruise PricingOur cruise ticket prices include accommodations and a wide variety of activities and amenities, including meals and entertainment. Prices vary depending on many factors including the destination, cruise length, stateroom category selected and the time of year the cruise takes place. Although we grant credit terms in select markets mainly outside of the United States, our payment terms generally require an upfront deposit to confirm a reservation, with the balance due prior to the sailing. Our cruises are generally available for sale at least one year in advance and often more than two years in advance of sailing. During the selling period of a cruise, we continually monitor and adjust our cruise ticket prices for available guest staterooms based on demand, with the objective of maximizing net yields. As we grow our business globally, our sale arrangements with travel agents may vary. For instance, although our direct business is growing at a rapid pace, sale arrangements through travel agent charter and group sales are proportionately higher in the China market than in our other markets which are primarily through retail agency and direct sales.We have developed and implemented enhancements to our reservations system that provide us and our travel partners with additional capabilities, making it easier to do business with us. For example, we offer air transportation to our guests through our air transportation program available in major cities around the world. Passenger ticket revenues accounted for approximately 72% of total revenues in 2019, 2018 and 2017. 14Table of ContentsOnboard Activities and Other RevenuesOur cruise brands offer modern fleets with a wide array of onboard services, amenities and activities which vary by brand and ship. While many onboard activities are included in the base price of a cruise, we realize additional revenues from, among other things, gaming, the sale of alcoholic and other beverages, Internet and other telecommunication services, gift shop items, shore excursions, photography, spa/salon and fitness services, art auctions, retail shops and a wide variety of specialty restaurants and dining options. Many of these services are available for pre-booking prior to embarkation. These activities are provided either directly by us or by independent concessionaires from which we receive a percentage of their revenues. In conjunction with our cruise vacations, we offer pre- and post-cruise hotel packages to our Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, Azamara and Silversea Cruises guests. We also offer cruise vacation protection coverage to guests in a number of markets, which provides guests with coverage for trip cancellation, medical protection and baggage protection. Onboard and other revenues accounted for approximately 28% of total revenues in 2019, 2018 and 2017.  Segment ReportingWe control and operate four cruise brands, Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, Azamara, and Silversea Cruises. In addition, we have a 50% investment in a joint venture with TUI AG which operates the German brand TUI Cruises and a 49% interest in the Spanish brand Pullmantur. We believe our brands possess the versatility to enter multiple cruise market segments within the cruise vacation industry. Although each of our brands has its own marketing style as well as ships and crews of various sizes, the nature of the products sold and services delivered by our brands share a common base (i.e., the sale and provision of cruise vacations). Our brands also have similar itineraries as well as similar cost and revenue components. In addition, our brands source passengers from similar markets around the world and operate in similar economic environments with a significant degree of commercial overlap. As a result, our brands have been aggregated as a single reportable segment based on the similarity of their economic characteristics, types of consumers, regulatory environment, maintenance requirements, supporting systems and processes as well as products and services provided. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the chief operating decision-maker and all significant operating decisions including the allocation of resources are based upon the analyses of the Company as one segment. (For financial information, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.)Employees As of December\\xa031, 2019, our Global Brands employed approximately 85,400 employees, including 77,000 shipboard employees as well as 8,200 full-time and 100 part-time employees in our shoreside operations. As of December\\xa031, 2019, approximately 89% of our shipboard employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Insurance We maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships, with insured values generally equal to the net book value of each ship. This coverage is maintained with reputable insurance underwriters from the British, Scandinavian, French, United States and other reputable international insurance markets.We are members of four Protection and Indemnity (\"P&I\") clubs, which are part of a worldwide group of 13 P&I clubs, known as the International Group of P&I Clubs (the “IG”). Liabilities, costs and expenses for illness and injury to crew, guest injury, pollution and other third-party claims in connection with our cruise activities are covered by our P&I clubs, subject to the clubs’ rules and the limits of coverage determined by the IG. P&I coverage provided by the clubs is on a mutual basis and we are subject to additional premium calls in the event of a catastrophic loss incurred by any member of the 13 P&I clubs, whereby the reinsurance limits purchased by the IG are exhausted. We are also subject to additional premium calls based on investment and underwriting shortfalls experienced by our own individual insurers.We maintain war risk insurance for legal liability to crew, guests and other third parties as well as for loss or damage to our vessels arising from acts of war, including invasion, insurrection, terrorism, rebellion, piracy and 15Table of Contentshijacking. Our primary war risk coverage is provided by a Norwegian war risk insurance association and our excess war risk insurance is provided by our four P&I clubs. Consistent with most marine war risk policies, our coverage is subject to cancellation in the event of a change in risk. In the event of a war between major powers, our primary policies terminate after thirty days’ notice and our excess policies terminate immediately. Our excess policies are also subject to cancellation after a notice period of seven days in the event of other changes in risk. These notice periods allow for premiums to be renegotiated based on changes in risk.Insurance coverage for other exposures, such as shoreside property and casualty, passenger off-vessel, directors and officers and network security and privacy, are maintained with various global insurance companies.We do not carry business interruption insurance for our ships based on our evaluation of the risks involved and protective measures already in place, as compared to the cost of insurance.All insurance coverage is subject to certain limitations, exclusions and deductible levels. In addition, in certain circumstances, we either self-insure or co-insure a portion of these risks. Premiums charged by insurance carriers, including carriers in the maritime insurance industry, increase or decrease from time to time and tend to be cyclical in nature. These cycles are impacted both by our own loss experience and by losses incurred in direct and reinsurance markets. We historically have been able to obtain insurance coverage in amounts and at premiums we have deemed to be commercially acceptable. No assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will be available to us in the future, particularly for war risk insurance. TrademarksWe own a number of registered trademarks related to the Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, Azamara and Silversea Cruises cruise brands. The registered trademarks include the name “Royal Caribbean International” and its crown and anchor logo, the name “Celebrity Cruises” and its “X” logo, the name “Azamara” and its \"open world\" and \"star logo\", the name “Silversea Cruises” and its logo, and the names of various cruise ships, ship venues and other marketing programs. We believe our largest brands\\' trademarks are widely recognized throughout the world and have considerable value. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.RegulationOur ships are regulated by various international, national, state and local laws, regulations and treaties in force in the jurisdictions in which they operate. In addition, our ships are registered in the Bahamas, Malta or in the case of our ships operating in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador. Each ship is subject to regulations issued by its country of registry, including regulations issued pursuant to international treaties governing the safety of our ships, guests and crew as well as environmental protection. Each country of registry conducts periodic inspections to verify compliance with these regulations as discussed more fully below. Ships operating out of ports of call around the world are also subject to inspection by the maritime authorities of that country for compliance with international treaties and local regulations. Additionally, ships operating out of the United States ports are subject to inspection by the United States Coast Guard for compliance with international treaties and by the United States Public Health Service for sanitary and health conditions. Our ships are also subject to similar inspections pursuant to the laws and regulations of various other countries our ships visit. We believe that we are in material compliance with all the regulations applicable to our ships and that we have all licenses necessary to conduct our business. Health, safety, security, environmental and financial responsibility issues are, and we believe will continue to be, an area of focus by the relevant government authorities in the United States and internationally. From time to time, various regulatory and legislative changes may be proposed that could impact our operations and subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future.Safety and Security RegulationsOur ships are required to comply with international safety standards defined in the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea (“SOLAS”), which, among other things, establishes requirements for ship design, structural features, materials, construction, lifesaving equipment and safe management and operation of ships to ensure guest and crew safety. The SOLAS standards are revised from time to time and changes are incorporated into the 16Table of Contentsoperation of our ships. Compliance with these modified standards have not historically had a material effect on our operating costs. SOLAS incorporates the International Safety Management Code (“ISM Code”), which provides an international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for pollution prevention. The ISM Code is mandatory for all vessels, including passenger vessel operators. All of our operations and ships are regularly audited by various national authorities, and we are required to maintain the relevant certificates of compliance with the ISM Code.Our ships are subject to various security requirements, including the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (“ISPS Code”), which is part of SOLAS, and the U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (“MTSA”), which applies to ships that operate in U.S. ports.  In order to satisfy these security requirements, we implement security measures, conduct vessel security assessments, and develop security plans. The security plans for all of our ships have been submitted to and approved by the Recognized Security Organization on behalf of the ships\\' flag state and are in compliance with the ISPS Code and the MTSA. The Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act of 2010, which applies to passenger vessels which embark or include port stops within the United States, requires the implementation of certain safety design features as well as the establishment of practices for the reporting of and dealing with allegations of crime. The cruise industry supported this legislation and we believe that our internal standards are generally as strict or stricter than the law requires. Some provisions of the act call for regulations which have not been finalized. We do not expect the pending regulations will have a material impact to our operations.Environmental RegulationsWe are subject to various international and national laws and regulations relating to environmental protection. Under such laws and regulations, we are generally prohibited from discharging materials other than food waste into the waterways. We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. From time to time, environmental and other regulators consider more stringent regulations, which may affect our operations and increase our compliance costs. We believe that the impact of ships on the global environment will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world and, accordingly, may subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future, including the items described below.Our ships are subject to the International Maritime Organization’s (‘‘IMO’’) regulations under the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (the ‘‘MARPOL Regulations’’) and the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships Ballast Water and Sediments (Ballast Water Management Convention), in addition to other regional and national regulations such as EU Directives and the US Vessel General Permit, which includes requirements designed to minimize pollution by oil, sewage, garbage, air emissions and the transfer of non-native/non-indigenous species. We have obtained the relevant international compliance certificates relating to oil, sewage, air pollution prevention and ballast water for all of our ships. The MARPOL Regulations imposed reduced global limitations on the sulfur content of emissions emitted by ships operating worldwide to 0.5% as of January 1, 2020, which was reduced from 3.5%. We do not expect that this increased limitation will have a material impact to our results of operations largely due to a number of mitigating steps we have taken over the last several years, including equipping all of our new ships delivered during or after 2014 with advanced emissions purification (\"AEP\") systems covering all engines and actively developing and installing AEP systems on the majority of our remaining fleet. The MARPOL Regulations also establish special Emission Control Areas (‘‘ECAs’’) with additional stringent limitations on sulfur emissions in these areas. There are four established ECAs that restrict sulfur emissions: the Baltic Sea, the North Sea/English Channel, certain waters surrounding the North American coast, and the waters surrounding Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (the “Caribbean ECA”). Ships operating in these sulfur ECAs have been required to reduce their emissions sulfur content to 0.1%. This reduction has not had a significant impact on our results of operations to date due to the mitigating steps described above. We continue to implement our AEP system strategy for both our ships on order and our existing fleet. As our new ships are delivered and additional existing ships are retrofitted with AEP systems, they will provide us with additional operational and deployment flexibility. 17Table of ContentsAdditionally, all new ships operating within the North American and U.S. Caribbean Sea ECA that began construction after January 1, 2016 are required to meet more stringent nitrogen oxide emission limits. We comply with these rules for those relevant ships in service. As an added measure, all of our ships under construction are being built to comply with these rules. The rules have not had and are not expected to have a significant impact to our operations or costs. Effective July 1, 2015, the European Commission adopted legislation that requires cruise ship operators with ships visiting ports in the European Union to monitor and report on the ship’s annual carbon dioxide emissions starting in 2018. Additionally, in 2019, the IMO\\'s monitoring and reporting system (IMO data and collection system), which is applicable to all ship itineraries, entered into force. While compliance with these regulations did not materially impact our costs or results of operations, the legislations contemplate further obligations and restrictions which could ultimately result in additional costs or charges associated with carbon dioxide emissions. The IMO Ballast Water Management Convention, which came in effect in 2017, requires ships that carry and discharge ballast water to meet specific discharge standards by installing Ballast Water Treatment Systems by 2023. Compliance with this regulation has not had a material effect on our results of operations and we do not expect the continuing compliance with this regulation to have a material effect on our results of operations. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - \"Environmental, labor, health and safety, financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase costs\" for further discussion of the risks associated with the regulations discussed above. Consumer Financial Responsibility RegulationsWe are required to obtain certificates from the United States Federal Maritime Commission relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of non-performance of obligations to guests, as well as casualty and personal injury. As a condition to obtaining the required certificates, we generally arrange through our insurers for the provision of surety for our ship-operating companies. The required amount is currently $32.0 million per operator and is subject to additional consumer price index based adjustments. We are also required by the United Kingdom, Norway, Finland and the Baltics to establish our financial responsibility for any liability resulting from the non-performance of our obligations to guests from these jurisdictions.  In the United Kingdom we are currently required by the Association of British Travel Agents to provide performance bonds totaling approximately £82 million. Additionally, we were required by the Civil Aviation Authority to provide performance bonds totaling £8 million. The Norwegian Travel Guarantee Fund requires us to maintain performance bonds in varying amounts during the course of the year to cover our financial responsibility in Norway, Finland and the Baltics. These amounts ranged from NOK 32 million to NOK 57 million during 2019.Certain other jurisdictions also require that we establish financial responsibility to our guests resulting from the non-performance of our obligations; however, the related amounts do not have a material effect on our costs. Taxation of the CompanyThe following is a summary of our principal taxes, exemptions and special regimes. In addition to or instead of income taxation, virtually all jurisdictions where our ships call impose some tax or fee, or both, based on guest headcount, tonnage or some other measure. We also collect and remit value added tax (VAT) or sales tax in many jurisdictions where we operate.Our consolidated operations are primarily foreign corporations engaged in the owning and operating of passenger cruise ships in international transportation. U.S. Income Taxation The following is a discussion of the application of the U.S. federal and state income tax laws to us and is based on the current provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, Treasury Department regulations, administrative rulings, court decisions and the relevant state tax laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions of the states where we have business operations. All of the foregoing is subject to change, and any such change could affect the accuracy of this discussion.18Table of ContentsApplication of Section 883 of the Internal Revenue CodeWe, Celebrity Cruises, Inc. and Silversea Cruises Ltd. are engaged in a trade or business in the United States, and many of our ship-owning subsidiaries, depending upon the itineraries of their ships, receive income from sources within the United States. Additionally, our United Kingdom tonnage tax company is a ship-operating company classified as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes that may earn U.S. source income. Under Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code, certain foreign corporations may exclude from gross income (and effectively from branch profits tax as such earnings do not give rise to effectively connected earnings and profits) U.S. source income derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships, including income from the leasing of such ships. A foreign corporation will qualify for the benefits of Section 883 if, in relevant part: (1) the foreign country in which the foreign corporation is organized grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the United States; and (2) the stock of the corporation (or the direct or indirect corporate parent thereof) is “primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market” in the United States. In the opinion of our U.S. tax counsel, Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP, based on the representations and assumptions set forth in that opinion, we, Celebrity Cruises Inc., Silversea Cruises Ltd. and relevant ship-owning subsidiaries with U.S. source shipping income qualify for the benefits of Section 883 because we and each of those subsidiaries are incorporated in Liberia or Bahamas, which are qualifying countries, and our common stock is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the United States (i.e., we are a \"publicly traded\" corporation). If, in the future, (1) Liberia or Bahamas no longer qualify as equivalent exemption jurisdictions, and we do not reincorporate in a jurisdiction that does qualify for the exemption, or (2) we fail to qualify as a publicly traded corporation, we and all of our ship-owning or operating subsidiaries that rely on Section 883 to exclude qualifying income from gross income would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on their U.S. source shipping income and income from activities incidental thereto. We believe that most of our income and the income of our ship-owning subsidiaries, including our U.K. tonnage tax company which is considered a division for U.S. tax purposes, is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships and, therefore, is exempt from taxation under Section 883. Regulations under Section 883 list activities that are not considered by the Internal Revenue Service to be incidental to the international operation of ships including the sale of air and land transportation, shore excursions and pre- and post-cruise tours. Our income from these activities that is earned from sources within the United States will be subject to U.S. taxation.  Taxation in the Absence of an Exemption Under Section 883 If we, the operator of our vessels, Celebrity Cruises Inc., Silversea Cruises Ltd., or our ship-owning subsidiaries were to fail to meet the requirements of Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code, or if the provision was repealed, then, as explained below, such companies would be subject to U.S. income taxation on a portion of their income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships.Because we, Celebrity Cruises Inc. and Silversea Cruises Ltd. conduct a trade or business in the United States, we, Celebrity Cruises Inc. and Silversea Cruises Ltd. would be taxable at regular corporate rates on our separate company taxable income (i.e., without regard to the income of our ship-owning subsidiaries) on income which is effectively connected with our U.S. trade or business (generally only income from U.S. sources). In addition, if any of our earnings and profits effectively connected with our U.S. trade or business were withdrawn, or were deemed to have been withdrawn, from our U.S. trade or business, those withdrawn amounts would be subject to a “branch profits” tax at the rate of 30%. We, Celebrity Cruises Inc. and Silversea Cruises Ltd. would also be potentially subject to tax on portions of certain interest paid by us at rates of up to 30%.If Section 883 were not available to our ship-owning subsidiaries, each such subsidiary would be subject to a special 4% tax on its U.S. source gross transportation income, if any, each year because it does not have a fixed place of business in the United States and its income is derived from the leasing of a ship.19Table of ContentsOther United States TaxationWe, Celebrity Cruises Inc. and Silversea Cruises Ltd. earn U.S. source income from activities not considered incidental to international shipping. The tax on such income is not material to our results of operation for all years presented. State TaxationWe, Celebrity Cruises Inc., Silversea Cruises Ltd. and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various U.S. state income taxes which are generally imposed on each state’s portion of the U.S. source income subject to federal income taxes.  Additionally, the state of Alaska subjects an allocated portion of the total income of companies doing business in Alaska and certain other affiliated companies to Alaska corporate state income taxes and also imposes a 33% tax on adjusted gross income from onboard gambling activities conducted in Alaska waters. This did not have a material impact to our results of operations for all years presented.2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law.\\xa0Among other things, the new legislation reduced the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from 35%, resulting in an immaterial benefit in 2017 related to the reduction of our U.S. deferred tax liability. Although there are a number of provisions which apply to us, there was no material impact to our overall tax expense as a result of the legislation. \\xa0Maltese and Spanish Income TaxationEffective July 31, 2016, we sold 51% of our interest in Pullmantur Holdings S.L. (\"Pullmantur Holdings\"), the parent company of the Pullmantur brand. We account for our retained investment under the equity method of accounting. There was no tax impact to us as a result of this sale transaction.  The Pullmantur group continues to be subject to the tax laws of Spain and Malta, among others. Under the sale agreement, we remain responsible for pre-sale tax matters with respect to years that are still open under the statute of limitations. United Kingdom Income TaxationDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we operated 16 ships under the United Kingdom tonnage tax regime (“U.K. tonnage tax”).  Companies subject to U.K. tonnage tax pay a corporate tax on a notional profit determined with reference to the net tonnage of qualifying vessels. The requirements for a company to qualify for the U.K. tonnage tax regime include being subject to U.K. corporate income tax, operating qualifying ships, which are strategically and commercially managed in the United Kingdom, and fulfilling a seafarer training requirement.Relevant shipping profits include income from the operation of qualifying ships and from shipping related activities. Our U.K. income from non-shipping activities which do not qualify under the U.K. tonnage tax regime and which are not considered significant, remain subject to regular U.K. corporate income tax. Chinese TaxationOur U.K. tonnage tax company operates ships in international transportation in China. The income earned from this operation is exempt from taxation in China under the U.K./China double tax treaty and other circulars addressing indirect taxes. Changes to or failure to qualify for the treaty or circular could cause us to lose the benefits provided which would have a material impact on our results of operations. Our Chinese income from non-shipping activities or from shipping activities not qualifying for treaty or circular protection and which are considered insignificant, remain subject to Chinese taxation. Other TaxationWe and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to value-added and other indirect taxes most of which are reclaimable, zero-rated or exempt. 20Table of ContentsWebsite Access to ReportsWe make available, free of charge, access to our Annual Reports, all quarterly and current reports and all amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission through our website at www.rclcorporate.com.

Risk FactorsThe risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historical results. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks. There may be additional risks that we consider not to be material, or which are not known, and any of these risks could have the effects set forth below.\\xa0The ordering of the risk factors set forth below is not intended to reflect any Company indication of priority or likelihood. See Item\\xa07. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements.Adverse worldwide economic or other conditions could reduce the demand for cruises and passenger spending, adversely impacting our operating results, cash flows and financial condition including potentially impairing the value of our ships and other assets.The demand for cruises is affected by international, national and local economic conditions. Weak or uncertain economic conditions impact consumer confidence and pose a risk as vacationers may postpone or reduce discretionary spending. This, in turn, may result in cruise booking slowdowns, decreased cruise prices and lower onboard revenues.  Given the global nature of our business, we are exposed to many different economies and our business could be hurt by challenging conditions in any of our markets. Any significant deterioration of international, national or local economic conditions, including those resulting from geopolitical events and/or international disputes, could result in a prolonged period of booking slowdowns, depressed cruise prices and/or reduced onboard revenues.Fears of terrorist attacks, war, and other hostilities could have a negative impact on our results of operations.Events such as terrorist attacks, war (or war-like conditions), conflicts (domestic or cross-border), civil unrest and other hostilities, including an escalation in the frequency or severity of incidents, and the resulting political instability, travel restrictions and advisories, and concerns over safety and security aspects of traveling or the fear of any of the foregoing have had, and could have in the future, a significant adverse impact on demand and pricing in the travel and vacation industry. In view of our global operations, we are susceptible to a wide range of adverse events. These events could also result in additional security measures taken by local authorities which may potentially impact access to ports and/or destinations.Our operating costs could increase due to market forces and economic or geo-political factors beyond our control.Our operating costs, including fuel, food, payroll and benefits, airfare, taxes, insurance and security costs, are all subject to increases due to market forces and economic or geo-political conditions or other factors beyond our control. Increases in these operating costs could adversely affect our profitability.Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, fuel prices and interest rates could affect our financial results.We are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, fuel prices and interest rates. Significant changes in any of the foregoing could have a material impact on our financial results, net of the impact of our hedging activities and natural offsets. Our operating results have been and will continue to be impacted, often significantly, by changes in each of these factors. The value of our earnings in foreign currencies is adversely impacted by a strong United States dollar. In addition, any significant increase in fuel prices could materially and adversely affect our business as fuel prices not only impact our fuel costs, but also some of our other expenses, such as crew travel, freight and commodity prices. Mandatory fuel restrictions, such as the International Maritime Organization\\'s 2020 Low Sulphur Regulation (\"IMO 2020\"), may also create uncertainty related to the price and availability of certain fuel types potentially impacting operating costs and the value of our related hedging instruments. Also, a significant increase in interest rates could materially impact the cost of our floating rate debt. Furthermore, regulatory changes, such as the announcement of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021, may adversely affect our portfolio of floating-rate debt and interest rate derivatives. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate any credit agreements or interest rate derivatives agreements extending beyond 2021 that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate or hedge rate, which could adversely impact our cost of debt. See “Item 7.\\xa0Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Item 7A.\\xa0Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for more information.23Table of ContentsConducting business globally may result in increased costs and other risks.We operate our business globally. Operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks, including increased exposure to a wider range of regional and local economic conditions, volatile local political conditions, potential changes in duties and taxes, including changing and/or uncertain interpretations of existing tax laws and regulations, required compliance with additional laws and policies affecting cruising, vacation or maritime businesses or governing the operations of foreign-based companies, currency fluctuations, interest rate movements, difficulties in operating under local business environments, port quality and availability in certain regions, U.S. and global anti-bribery laws or regulations, imposition of trade barriers and restrictions on repatriation of earnings. Our future growth strategies increasingly depend on the growth and sustained profitability of certain international markets, such as China. Some factors that will be critical to our success in developing these markets may be different than those affecting our more-established North American and European markets. In the Chinese market, in particular, our future success depends on our ability to continue to raise awareness of our products, evolve the available distribution channels and adapt our offerings to best suit the Chinese consumer. China’s economy differs from the economies of other developed countries in many respects and, as the legal and regulatory system in China continues to evolve, there may be greater uncertainty as to the interpretation and enforcement of applicable laws and regulations. Operating globally also exposes us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal, regulatory and tax requirements. In many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate, practices in the local business communities might not conform to international business standards. We must adhere to policies designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance as well as applicable laws and regulations. However, we might not be successful in ensuring that our employees, agents, representatives and other third parties with whom we associate throughout the world properly adhere to them. Failure by us, our employees or any of these third parties to adhere to our policies or applicable laws or regulations could result in penalties, sanctions, damage to our reputation and related costs which in turn could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows.We have operations in and source passengers from the United Kingdom and the European Union. On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union and immediately entered an 11-month transition period. Uncertainty during the transition period could lead to adverse effects on the economy of the United Kingdom, including the value of the British Pound, and the other economies in which we operate, making it more difficult to source passengers from these regions. Additionally, if the withdrawal is not executed effectively, it could adversely affect tax, legal and regulatory regimes to which our business in the region is subject. The withdrawal could also, among other potential outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union, if not executed effectively. As a global operator, our business may be also impacted by changes in U.S. policy or priorities in areas such as trade, immigration and/or environmental or labor regulations, among others.\\xa0Depending on the nature and scope of any such changes, they could impact our domestic and international business operations.\\xa0Any such changes, and any international response to them, could potentially introduce new barriers to passenger or crew travel and/or cross border transactions, impact our guest experience and/or increase our operating costs.If we are unable to address these risks adequately, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected, including potentially impairing the value of our ships and other assets.  Changes in U.S. foreign travel policy may affect our results of operations.Changes in U.S. foreign policy could result in the imposition of travel restrictions or travel bans on U.S. persons to certain countries or result in the imposition of U.S. rules, regulations or legislation that could expose us to penalties or claims of monetary damages. The timing and scope of these changes are unpredictable, and they could cause us to cancel scheduled sailings, possibly on short notice, or could result in possible litigation against us. This, in turn, could decrease our revenue, increase our operating costs and otherwise impair our profitability. For instance, in June 2019, the U.S. government announced that cruise ships would no longer be allowed to travel between the U.S. and Cuba. This required us to change our high yielding Cuba sailings on short notice, which impacted our earnings. Moreover, in May 2019, the U.S. government activated Title III of the Cuban Liberty and Solidarity (Libertad) Act of 1996, popularly known as the Helms-Burton Act. This allowed certain individuals 24Table of Contentswhose property was confiscated by the Cuban government to sue in U.S. courts anyone who \"traffics\" in the property in question. The activation of Title III has resulted in litigation against us and others in the tourism industry.Price increases for commercial airline service for our guests or major changes or reduction in commercial airline service and/or availability could adversely impact the demand for cruises and undermine our ability to provide reasonably priced vacation packages to our guests.Many of our guests depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to or from the ports where our cruises embark or disembark. Increases in the price of airfare would increase the overall price of the cruise vacation to our guests, which may adversely impact demand for our cruises. In addition, changes in the availability of commercial airline services could adversely affect our guests’ ability to obtain air travel, as well as our ability to transfer our guests to or from our cruise ships, which could adversely affect our results of operations.Incidents on ships, at port facilities, land destinations and/or affecting the cruise vacation industry in general, and the associated negative media coverage and publicity, could affect our reputation and impact our sales and results of operations. The ownership and/or operation of cruise ships, private destinations, port facilities and shore excursions involves the risk of accidents, illnesses, mechanical failures, environmental incidents and other incidents which may bring into question safety, health, security and vacation satisfaction and can  negatively impact our sales, operations and reputation. Incidents involving cruise ships, and, in particular the safety, health and security of guests and crew and the media coverage thereof have impacted and could in the future impact demand for our cruises and pricing in the industry. Our reputation and our business could also be damaged by negative publicity regarding the cruise industry in general, including publicity regarding the spread of contagious disease, over-tourism in key ports and destinations and the potentially adverse environmental impacts of cruising. The considerable expansion in the use of social and digital media over recent years has compounded the potential scope and reach of any negative publicity. If any such incident or news cycle occurs during a time of high seasonal demand, the effect could disproportionately impact our results of operations for the year. In addition, incidents involving cruise ships may result in additional costs to our business, increasing government or other regulatory oversight and, in certain cases, potential litigation.Significant weather, climate events and/or natural disasters could adversely impact our business and results from operations. Natural disasters (e.g. earthquakes), weather and/or climate events (including hurricanes and typhoons) could impact our source markets and operations resulting in travel restrictions, guest cancellations, an inability to source our crew or our provisions and supplies from certain places. We are often forced to alter itineraries and occasionally cancel a cruise or a series of cruises or to redeploy our ships due to these types of events, which could have an adverse effect on our sales, operating costs and profitability in the current and future periods. Increases in the frequency, severity or duration of these types of events could exacerbate their impact and cause further disruption to our operations or make certain destinations less desirable or unavailable impacting our revenues and profitability further. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and on industry performance. Disease outbreaks and an increase in concern about the risk of illness could adversely impact our business and results from operations.Disease outbreaks and increased concern related to illness when travelling to, from, and on our ships could cause a drop in demand for cruises, guest cancellations, travel restrictions, an unavailability of ports and/or destinations, cruise cancellations, ship redeployments and an inability to source our crew, provisions or supplies from certain places. The recent coronavirus outbreak is currently having these impacts on our operations and, given its fluid and developing nature, has made it extremely difficult for us to forecast the impact it could have on our future operations. For instance, the resulting measures taken by China and other countries to contain the disease, including travel restrictions, have resulted in the cancellation or itinerary modification of an increasing number of our cruises in Southeast Asia. In addition, our imposition of measures to protect our guests and crew, including denying boarding to those that have traveled from, to or through mainland China or Hong Kong, has caused us to cancel cruise bookings or restrict certain guests from booking our cruises. All of these issues are having and are likely to continue to have a material impact on our bookings, operations and our overall financial performance.25Table of ContentsAn increase in capacity worldwide or excess capacity in a particular market could adversely impact our cruise sales and/or pricing.Although our ships can be redeployed, cruise sales and/or pricing may be impacted by the introduction of new ships into the marketplace, reductions in cruise capacity, overall market growth and deployment decisions of ourselves and our competitors. As of December\\xa031, 2019, a total of 67 new ships with approximately 159,000 berths are on order for delivery through 2024 in the cruise industry. The further net growth in capacity from these new ships and future orders, without an increase in the cruise industry’s demand and/or share of the vacation market, could depress cruise prices and impede our ability to achieve yield improvement. In addition, to the extent that we or our competitors deploy ships to a particular itinerary/region and the resulting capacity in that region exceeds the demand, we may lower pricing and profitability may be lower than anticipated. This risk exists in emerging cruise markets, where capacity has grown rapidly over the past few years and in mature markets where excess capacity is typically redeployed. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, including potentially impairing the value of our ships and other assets.Unavailability of ports of call may adversely affect our results of operations.We believe that port destinations are a major reason why guests choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation. The availability of ports and destinations is affected by a number of factors, including industry demand and competition for key ports and destinations, existing capacity constraints, constraints related to the size of certain ships, security, financial limitations on port development, exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors, geopolitical developments and local governmental regulations. In addition, fuel costs may adversely impact the destinations on certain of our itineraries. Increased demand and competition for key ports of call or destinations, limitations on the availability or feasibility of use of specific ports of call and/or constraints on the availability of shore excursions and other service providers at such ports or destinations could adversely affect our results of operations.Growing anti-tourism sentiments and environmental concerns related to cruising could adversely impact our operations.Certain ports and destinations are facing a surge of both cruise and non-cruise tourism which, in certain cases, has fueled anti-tourism sentiments and related countermeasures to limit the volume of tourists allowed in these destinations. In certain destinations, countermeasures to limit the volume of tourists are being contemplated and/or put into effect, including proposed limits on cruise ships and cruise passengers. For example, effective 2020, the local government of Dubrovnik, Croatia will cap the number of cruise ships that can dock each day to two and the number of corresponding passengers. Similar existing and potential restrictions in ports and destinations such as Venice and Barcelona could limit the itinerary and destination options we can offer our passengers going forward. Some environmental groups have also generated negative publicity about the environmental impact of the cruise vacation industry and are advocating for more stringent regulation of ship emissions at berth and at sea. These anti-tourism sentiments and growing environmental scrutiny of the cruise industry and any related countermeasures could adversely impact our operations and financial results and subject us to increasing compliance costs.Our reliance on shipyards, their subcontractors and our suppliers to implement our newbuild and ship upgrade programs and to repair and maintain our ships exposes us to risks which, if realized, could adversely impact our business.We rely on shipyards, their subcontractors and our suppliers to effectively construct our new ships and to repair, maintain and upgrade our existing ships on a timely basis and in a cost effective manner. There are a limited number of shipyards with the capability and capacity to build, repair, maintain and/or upgrade our ships. Increased demand for available new construction slots and/or continued consolidation in the cruise shipyard industry could impact our ability to: (1) construct new ships, when and as planned, (2) cause us to continue to commit to new ship orders earlier than we have historically done so and/or (3) result in stronger bargaining power on the part of the shipyards and the export credit agencies providing financing for the project. Current market conditions characterized by limited shipyard capacity, high demand for shipyard and sub-contractor resources and the growing application of advanced technologies to newbuilds (e.g. LNG) could cause delays in ship deliveries and 26Table of Contentsscheduled drydocks across the industry. Our inability to timely and cost-effectively procure new capacity and the potential delay in ship deliveries and/or scheduled drydocks or modernizations could have a significant negative impact on our future business plans and results of operations.  Building, repairing, maintaining and/or upgrading a ship is also sophisticated work that involves significant risks.  In addition, the prices of labor and/or various commodities that are used in the construction of ships can be subject to volatile price changes, including the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Shipyards, their subcontractors and/or our suppliers may encounter financial, technical or design problems when doing these jobs.\\xa0 If materialized, these problems could impact the timely delivery or costs of new ships or the ability of shipyards to repair and upgrade our fleet in accordance with our needs or expectations.\\xa0 In addition, delays, mechanical faults and/or unforeseen incidents, such as the collapse of the drydock structure at the Grand Bahama Shipyard involving Oasis of the Seas, may result in cancellation of cruises or, in more severe situations, new ship orders, or necessitate unscheduled drydocks and repairs of ships. These events and any related adverse publicity could result in lost revenue, increased operating expenses, or both, and thus adversely affect our results of operations.We may lose business to competitors throughout the vacation market.We operate in the vacation market and cruising is one of many alternatives for people choosing a vacation. We therefore risk losing business not only to other cruise lines, but also to other vacation operators, which provide other leisure options, including hotels, resorts, internet-based alternative lodging sites and package holidays and tours.We face significant competition from other cruise lines on the basis of cruise pricing, travel agent preference and also in terms of the nature of ships, services and destinations that we offer to guests. Our principal competitors within the cruise vacation industry include Carnival Corporation\\xa0& plc, which owns, among others, Aida Cruises, Carnival Cruise Line, Costa Cruises, Cunard Line, Holland America Line, P&O Cruises, Princess Cruises and Seabourn; Disney Cruise Line; MSC Cruises; and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd, which owns Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises. Our revenues are sensitive to the actions of other cruise lines in many areas including pricing, scheduling, capacity and promotions, which can have a substantial adverse impact not only on our revenues, but on overall industry revenues. In the event that we do not effectively market or differentiate our cruise brands from our competitors or otherwise compete effectively with other vacation alternatives and new or existing cruise companies, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.We may not be able to obtain sufficient financing or capital for our needs or may not be able to do so on terms that are acceptable or consistent with our expectations.To fund our capital expenditures (including new ship orders), operations and scheduled debt payments, we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations, drawdowns under available credit facilities, the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sale of equity or debt securities in private or public securities markets. Any circumstance or event which leads to a decrease in consumer cruise spending, such as worsening global economic conditions or significant incidents impacting the cruise industry, could negatively affect our operating cash flows. See “-Adverse worldwide economic or other conditions…” and “-Incidents or adverse publicity concerning our ships and/or passengers or the cruise vacation industry…” for more information.Although we believe we can access sufficient liquidity to fund our operations, investments and obligations as expected, there can be no assurances to that effect. Our ability to access additional funding as and when needed, our ability to timely refinance and/or replace our outstanding debt securities and credit facilities on acceptable terms and our cost of funding will depend upon numerous factors including, but not limited to, the vibrancy of the financial markets, our financial performance, the performance of our industry in general and the size, scope and timing of our financial needs. In addition, even where financing commitments have been secured, significant disruptions in the capital and credit markets could cause our banking and other counterparties to breach their contractual obligations to us. This could include failures of banks or other financial service companies to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements or to pay us amounts that may become due or return collateral that is refundable under our derivative contracts for hedging of fuel prices, interest rates and foreign currencies or other agreements. If any of the foregoing occurs it may have a negative impact on our cash flows, including our ability to meet our obligations, our results of operations and our financial condition.27Table of ContentsOur liquidity could be adversely impacted if we are unable to satisfy the covenants required by our credit facilities.Our debt agreements contain covenants, including covenants restricting our and their ability to take certain actions and financial covenants. Our ability to maintain our credit facilities may also be impacted by changes in our ownership base. More specifically, we may be required to prepay our bank financing facilities if any person acquires ownership of more than 50% of our common stock or, subject to certain exceptions, during any 24-month period, a majority of our board of directors is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of our board of directors on the first day of such period. \\xa0Our public debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by a third-party acquisition of greater than 50% of our common stock coupled with a ratings downgrade. Failure to comply with the terms of these debt facilities could result in an event of default. Generally, if an event of default under any debt agreement occurs, then pursuant to cross default acceleration clauses, our outstanding debt and derivative contract payables could become due and/or terminated. In addition, in such events, our credit card processors could hold back payments to create a reserve. We cannot provide assurances that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay, or the ability to refinance the debt if such amounts were accelerated upon an event of default.If we are unable to appropriately balance our cost management and capital allocation strategies with our goal of satisfying guest expectations, it may adversely impact our business success.Our goals call for us to provide high quality products and deliver high quality services. There can be no assurance that we can successfully balance these goals with our cost management and capital allocation strategies. Our business also requires us to make capital allocation decisions across a broad scope of investment options with varying return profiles and time horizons for value realization. These include significant capital investment decisions such as ordering new ships, upgrading our existing fleet, enhancing our technology and/or data capabilities, and expanding our portfolio of land-based assets, based on expected market preferences, competition and projected demand. There can be no assurance that our strategies will be successful, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Investments in older tonnage, in particular, run the risk of not meeting expected returns and diluting related asset values.Our attempts to expand our business into new markets and new ventures may not be successful.We opportunistically seek to grow our business through, among other things, expansion into new destinations or source markets and establishment of new ventures complementary to our current offerings. These attempts to expand our business increase the complexity of our business, require significant levels of investment and can strain our management, personnel, operations and systems. There can be no assurance that these business expansion efforts will develop as anticipated or that we will succeed, and if we do not, we may be unable to recover our investment, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.Risks associated with our development and operation of key land-based destination projects may adversely impact our business or results of operations.We have invested, and will continue to invest, either directly or indirectly through joint ventures and partnerships, in a growing portfolio of key land-based projects including port and terminal facilities, private destinations and multi-brand destination projects. These investments can  increase our exposure to certain key risks depending on the scope, location, and the ownership and management structure of these projects. These risks include susceptibility to weather events, exposure to local political/regulatory developments and policies, logistical challenges and human resource and labor risks.Our reliance on travel agencies to sell and market our cruises exposes us to certain risks which, if realized, could adversely impact our business.We rely on travel agencies to generate the majority of bookings for our ships.  Accordingly, we must ensure that our commission rates and incentive structures remain competitive. If we fail to offer competitive compensation packages or fail to maintain our relationships, these agencies may be incentivized to sell cruises offered by our competitors to our detriment, which could adversely impact our operating results.  Our reliance on third-party sellers is particularly pronounced in certain markets. In addition, the travel agent industry is sensitive to economic 28Table of Contentsconditions that impact discretionary income of consumers. Significant disruptions, especially disruptions impacting those agencies that sell a high volume of our business, or contractions in the industry could reduce the number of travel agencies available for us to market and sell our cruises, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Disruptions in our shoreside or shipboard operations or our information systems may adversely affect our results of operations.Our principal executive office and principal shoreside operations are located in Florida, and we have shoreside offices throughout the world. Actual or threatened natural disasters (e.g., hurricanes/typhoons, earthquakes, tornadoes, fires or floods) or similar events in these locations may have a material impact on our business continuity, reputation and results of operations. In addition, substantial or repeated information system failures, computer viruses or cyber attacks impacting our shoreside or shipboard operations could adversely impact our business. We do not generally carry business interruption insurance for our shoreside or shipboard operations or our information systems. As such, any losses or damages incurred by us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.The loss of key personnel, our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel, or disruptions among our shipboard personnel due to strained employee relations could adversely affect our results of operations.Our success depends, in large part, on the skills and contributions of key executives and other employees, and on our ability to recruit, develop and retain high quality personnel as well as having adequate succession plans. As demand for qualified personnel in the industry grows, we must continue to effectively recruit, train, motivate and retain our employees, both shoreside and on our ships, in order to effectively compete in our industry, maintain our current business and support our projected global growth. As of December\\xa031, 2019, 89% of our shipboard employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. A dispute under our collective bargaining agreements could result in a work stoppage of those employees covered by the agreements. We may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements when they expire. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage on our ships. We may also be subject to or affected by work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements. Any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, as could a loss of key employees, our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel or disruptions among our personnel. Business activities that involve our co-investments with third parties may subject us to additional risks.Partnerships, joint ventures and other business structures involving our co-investments with third parties generally include some form of shared control over the operations of the business and create additional risks, including the possibility that other investors in such ventures could become bankrupt or otherwise lack the financial resources to meet their obligations, or could have or develop business interests, policies or objectives that are inconsistent with ours. In addition to financial risks, our co-investment activities may also present managerial and operational risks and expose us to reputational or legal concerns. These or other issues related to our co-investments with third parties could adversely impact our operations.Past or pending business acquisitions or potential acquisitions that we may decide to pursue in the future carry inherent risks which could adversely impact our financial performance and condition.The Company, from time to time, has engaged in acquisitions (e.g., our Silversea Cruises acquisition) and may pursue acquisitions in the future, which are subject to, among other factors, the Company’s ability to identify attractive business opportunities and to negotiate favorable terms for such opportunities. Accordingly, the Company cannot make any assurances that potential acquisitions will be completed timely or at all, or that if completed, we would realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisition. Acquisitions also carry inherent risks such as, among others: (1) the potential delay or failure of our efforts to successfully integrate business processes and realizing expected synergies; (2) difficulty in aligning procedures, controls and/or policies; and (3) future unknown liabilities and costs that may be associated with an acquisition. In addition, acquisitions may also adversely impact our liquidity and/or debt levels, and the recognized value of goodwill and other intangible assets can be negatively 29Table of Contentsaffected by unforeseen events and/or circumstances, which may result in an impairment charge. Any of the foregoing events could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.We rely on supply chain vendors and third-party service providers who are integral to the operations of our businesses. These vendors and service providers may be unable or unwilling to deliver on their commitments or may act in ways that could harm our business.We rely on supply chain vendors to deliver key products to the operations of our businesses around the world. Any event impacting a vendor’s ability to deliver goods of the expected quality at the location and time needed could negatively impact our ability to deliver our cruise experience. Events impacting our supply chain could be caused by factors beyond the control of our suppliers or us, including inclement weather, natural disasters, increased demand, problems in production or distribution and/or disruptions in third-party logistics or transportation systems, such as those caused by the recent coronavirus. Interruptions to our supply chain could increase costs and could limit the availability of products critical to our operations. In order to achieve cost and operational efficiencies, we outsource to third-party vendors certain services that are integral to the operations of our global businesses, such as our onboard concessionaires, certain of our call center operations and operation of a large part of our information technology systems. We are subject to the risk that certain decisions are subject to the control of our third-party service providers and that these decisions may adversely affect our activities. A failure to adequately monitor a third-party service provider’s compliance with a service level agreement or regulatory or legal requirements could result in significant economic and reputational harm to us. There is also a risk the confidentiality, privacy and/or security of data held by third parties or communicated over third-party networks or platforms could become compromised.If we are unable to keep pace with developments in technology or technological obsolescence, our operations or competitive position could become impaired.Our business continues to demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems. These technologies and systems require significant investment and must be proven, refined, updated, upgraded and/or replaced with more advanced systems in order to continue to meet our customers’ demands and expectations. If we are unable to do so in a timely manner or within reasonable cost parameters or if we are unable to appropriately and timely train our employees to operate any of these new systems, our business could suffer. We also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system, which could result in higher than anticipated costs or impair our operating results.We are exposed to cyber security attacks and data breaches, including the risks and costs associated with protecting our systems and maintaining  integrity and security of our business information, as well as personal data of our guests, employees and business partners.We are subject to cyber security attacks. These cyber attacks can vary in scope and intent from attacks with the objective of compromising our systems, networks and communications for economic gain to attacks with the objective of disrupting, disabling or otherwise compromising our maritime and/or shoreside operations. The attacks can encompass a wide range of methods and intent, including phishing attacks, illegitimate requests for payment, theft of intellectual property, theft of confidential or non-public information, installation of malware, installation of ransomware and theft of personal or business information. The breadth and scope of these attacks, as well as the techniques and sophistication used to conduct these attacks, have grown over time.A successful cyber security attack may target us directly, or it may be the result of a third party\\'s inadequate care. In either scenario, the Company may suffer damage to its systems and data that could interrupt our operations, adversely impact our reputation and brand and expose us to increased risks of governmental investigation, litigation, fines and other liability, any of which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, responding to such an attack and mitigating the risk of future attacks could result in additional operating and capital costs in systems technology, personnel, monitoring and other investments.   In addition, we are also subject to various risks associated with the collection, handling, storage and transmission of sensitive information. In the course of doing business, we collect large volumes of employee, customer and other third-party data, including personally identifiable information and individual credit data, for various business purposes. We are subject to federal, state and international laws (including the European Union 30Table of ContentsGeneral Data Protection Regulation), as well as industry standards, relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information and individual credit data. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between the Company and its subsidiaries, and among the Company, its subsidiaries and other parties with which the Company has commercial relations. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements has caused, and may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices. If we fail to comply with the various applicable data collection and privacy laws, we could be exposed to fines, penalties, restrictions, litigation or other expenses, and our business could be adversely impacted.While we continue to evolve our cyber security practices in line with our business\\' reliance on technology and the changing external threat landscape, and we invest time, effort and financial resources to secure our systems, networks and communications, our security measures cannot provide absolute assurance that we will be successful in preventing or responding to all cyber security attacks. There can be no assurance that any breach or incident will not have a material impact on our operations and financial results. Any breach, theft, loss, or fraudulent use of guest, employee, third-party or company data, could adversely impact our reputation and brand and our ability to retain or attract new customers, and expose us to risks of data loss, business disruption, governmental investigation, litigation and other liability, any of which could adversely affect our business. Significant capital investments and other expenditures could be required to remedy the problem and prevent future breaches, including costs associated with additional security technologies, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached. Further, if we or our vendors experience significant data security breaches or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant data security breaches, we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation.The potential unavailability of insurance coverage, an inability to obtain insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or our failure to have coverage in sufficient amounts to cover our incurred losses may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.We seek to maintain appropriate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates. We normally insure based on the cost of an asset rather than replacement value and we also elect to self-insure, co-insure, or use deductibles in certain circumstances for certain risks such as loss of use of a ship or a cyber security breach. The limits of insurance coverage we purchase are based on the availability of the coverage, evaluation of our risk profile and cost of coverage. Accordingly, we are not protected against all risks and we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred which could result in an unexpected decrease in our revenue and results of operations in the event of an incident.We are members of four Protection and Indemnity (\"P&I\") clubs, which are part of a worldwide group of 13 P&I clubs, known as the International Group of P&I Clubs (the “IG”).  P&I coverage provided by the clubs is on a mutual basis and we are subject to additional premium calls in the event of a catastrophic loss incurred by any member of the 13 P&I clubs, whereby the reinsurance limits purchased by the IG are exhausted. We are also subject to additional premium calls based on investment and underwriting shortfalls experienced by our own individual insurers.We cannot be certain that insurance and reinsurance coverage will be available to us and at commercially reasonable rates in the future or at all or, if available, that it will be sufficient to cover potential claims.  Additionally, if we or other insureds sustain significant losses, the result may be higher insurance premiums, cancellation of coverage, or the inability to obtain coverage.  Such events could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.Environmental, labor, health and safety, financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase operating costs.The United States and various state and foreign government or regulatory agencies have enacted or may enact environmental regulations or policies, such as requiring the use of low sulfur fuels (e.g. IMO 2020), that could increase our direct cost to operate in certain markets, increase our cost for fuel, limit the supply of compliant fuel, cause us to incur significant expenses to purchase and/or develop new equipment and adversely impact the cruise 31Table of Contentsvacation industry. While we have taken and expect to continue to take a number of actions to mitigate the potential impact of certain of these regulations, there can be no assurances that these efforts will be successful or completed on a timely basis.There is increasing global regulatory focus on climate change, greenhouse gas (GHG) and other emissions.  These regulatory efforts, both internationally and in the United States are still developing, and we cannot yet determine what the final regulatory programs or their impact will be in any jurisdiction where we do business. However, such climate change-related regulatory activity in the future may adversely affect our business and financial results by requiring us to reduce our emissions, purchase allowances or otherwise pay for our emissions. Such activity may also impact us by increasing our operating costs, including fuel costs.In addition, we are subject to various international, national, state and local laws, regulations and treaties that govern, among other things, discharge from our ships, safety standards applicable to our ships, treatment of disabled persons, health and sanitary standards applicable to our guests, security standards on board our ships and at the ship/port interface areas, and financial responsibilities to our guests. These issues are, and we believe will continue to be, an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world. This could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that could subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future.A change in our tax status under the United States Internal Revenue Code, or other jurisdictions, may have adverse effects on our income.We and a number of our subsidiaries are foreign corporations that derive income from a U.S. trade or business and/or from sources within the United States. In connection with the year end audit, each year, Drinker Biddle\\xa0& Reath LLP, our U.S. tax counsel, delivers to us an opinion, based on certain representations and assumptions set forth in it, to the effect that this income, to the extent derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships, is excluded from gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section\\xa0883 of the Internal Revenue Code. We believe that most of our income (including that of our subsidiaries) is derived from or incidental to the international operation of ships.Our ability to rely on Section\\xa0883 could be challenged or could change in the future. Provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, including Section\\xa0883, are subject to legislative change at any time. Moreover, changes could occur in the future with respect to the identity, residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders, trading volume or trading frequency of our shares, or relevant foreign tax laws of Liberia or Bahamas, such that they no longer qualify as equivalent exemption jurisdictions, that could affect our eligibility for the Section\\xa0883 exemption. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be exempt from U.S. income tax on U.S. source shipping income in the future. If we were not entitled to the benefit of Section\\xa0883, we and our subsidiaries would be subject to U.S. taxation on a portion of the income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships, which would reduce our net income.Additionally, portions of our business are operated by companies that are within the United Kingdom tonnage tax regime. Further, some of our operations are conducted in jurisdictions where we rely on tax treaties to provide exemption from taxation. To the extent the United Kingdom tonnage tax laws change or we do not continue to meet the applicable qualification requirements or if tax treaties are changed or revoked, we may be required to pay higher income tax in these jurisdictions, adversely impacting our results of operations.As budgetary constraints continue to adversely impact the jurisdictions in which we operate, increases in income tax regulations, tax audits or tax reform affecting our operations may be imposed.Litigation, enforcement actions, fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations and/or damage our reputation.Our business is subject to various United States and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions, fines, civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages. In addition, improper conduct by our employees, agents or joint venture partners could damage our reputation and/or lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines. In certain circumstances it may not be economical to defend against such matters and/or our legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter. Such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.32Table of ContentsWe are not a United States corporation and our shareholders may be subject to the uncertainties of a foreign legal system in protecting their interests.Our corporate affairs are governed by our Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws and by the Business Corporation Act of Liberia. The provisions of the Business Corporation Act of Liberia resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the United States. However, while most states have a fairly well developed body of case law interpreting their respective corporate statutes, there are very few judicial cases in Liberia interpreting the Business Corporation Act of Liberia. As such, the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under Liberian law are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial precedent in certain United States jurisdictions. For example, the right of shareholders to bring a derivative action in Liberian courts may be more limited than in United States jurisdictions. There may also be practical difficulties for shareholders attempting to bring suit in Liberia and Liberian courts may or may not recognize and enforce foreign judgments. Thus, our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests with respect to actions by management, directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a United States jurisdiction.Provisions of our Articles of Incorporation, By-Laws and Liberian law could inhibit others from acquiring us, prevent a change of control, and may prevent efforts by our shareholders to change our management.Certain provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws and Liberian law may inhibit third parties from effectuating a change of control of the Company without approval from our board of directors which could result in the entrenchment of current management. These include provisions in our Articles of Incorporation that prevent third parties, other than A. Wilhelmsen AS. and Cruise Associates, from acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 4.9% of our outstanding shares without the consent of our board of directors.33Table of ContentsItem 1B.

Information regarding our cruise ships under construction, estimated expenditures and financing may be found within the Future Capital Commitments and Funding Needs and Sources sections of Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Our principal executive office and principal shoreside operations are located in leased office buildings at the Port of Miami, Florida. We also lease a number of other offices in the U.S. and throughout Europe, Asia, Mexico, South America and Australia to administer our brand operations globally.We believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs and that we are capable of obtaining additional facilities as necessary. We also operate two private destinations which we utilize as ports-of-call on certain itineraries: (i) an island we own in the Bahamas which we call CocoCay; and (ii) Labadee, a secluded peninsula we lease on the north coast of Haiti.Item\\xa03.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Legal Proceedings On August 27, 2019, two lawsuits were filed against Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida under Title III of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, also known as the Helms-Burton Act. The complaint filed by Havana Docks Corporation alleges it holds an interest in the Havana Cruise Port Terminal and the complaint filed by Javier Garcia-Bengochea alleges that he holds an interest in the Port of Santiago, Cuba, both of which were expropriated by the Cuban Government. The complaints further allege that Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. trafficked in those properties by embarking and disembarking passengers at these facilities. The plaintiffs seek all available statutory remedies, including the value of the expropriated property, plus interest, treble damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. filed its answer to each complaint on October 4, 2019. We believe we have meritorious defenses to the claims, and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against them. We believe that it is unlikely that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse impact to our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and there can be no assurances that the final outcome of this case will not be material.We are routinely involved in claims typical within the travel and tourism industry. The majority of these claims are covered by insurance. Although the outcome of any litigation is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, we believe it is unlikely that the outcome of such claims, net of expected insurance recoveries, will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Item\\xa04.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Mine Safety DisclosuresNone.34Table of ContentsPART IIItem\\xa05.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Market for Registrant\\'s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesMarket InformationOur common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") under the symbol \"RCL.\"HoldersAs of February\\xa021, 2020, there were 1,318 record holders of our common stock.

OverviewThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is organized to present the following:•a review of our critical accounting policies and of our financial presentation, including discussion of certain operational and financial metrics we utilize to assist us in managing our business;•a discussion of our results of operations for the year ended December\\xa031, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 and the year ended December\\xa031, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017;•a discussion of our business outlook, including our expectations for selected financial items for the first quarter and full year of 2020; and•a discussion of our liquidity and capital resources, including our future capital and contractual commitments and potential funding sources.39Table of ContentsCritical Accounting PoliciesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). (Refer to Note\\xa01. General and Note\\xa02. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements under Item\\xa08. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). Certain of our accounting policies are deemed \"critical,\" as they require management\\'s highest degree of judgment, estimates and assumptions. We have discussed these accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. We believe our most critical accounting policies are as follows:Ship AccountingShips represent our most significant assets and are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of ships is generally computed net of a 10%-15% projected residual value, using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, which is generally 30-35 years. The 30-35 year useful life and 10%-15% residual value is the weighted-average of all major components of a ship. Our useful life and residual value estimates take into consideration the impact of anticipated technological changes, long-term cruise and vacation market conditions and historical useful lives of similarly-built ships. In addition, we take into consideration our estimates of the weighted-average useful lives of the ships\\' major component systems, such as hull, superstructure, main electric, engines and cabins. We employ a cost allocation methodology at the component level, in order to support the estimated weighted-average useful lives and residual values, as well as to determine the net cost basis of assets being replaced. Given the very large and complex nature of our ships, our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain. We do not have cost segregation studies performed to specifically componentize our ship systems. However, we estimate the costs, useful lives and residual values of component systems based principally on general and technical information known about major ship component systems and their lives, as well as our knowledge of the cruise vacation industry. We do not identify and track depreciation by ship component systems, but instead utilize these estimates to determine the net cost basis of assets replaced or refurbished. Improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as additions to the ship and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements\\' estimated useful lives or that of the associated ship. The estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of replaced or refurbished ship components are written off and any resulting losses are recognized within Cruise operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).We periodically review estimated useful lives and residual values for ongoing reasonableness, considering long term views on our intended use of each class of ships and the planned level of improvements to maintain and enhance vessels within those classes. In the event a factor is identified that may trigger a change in the estimated useful lives and residual values of our ships, a review of the estimate is completed. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we completed a modernization of the Oasis of the Seas under our ship upgrade program. The level of capital investment, as well as planned investment levels in the other ships within the Oasis class, triggered a review of the estimated useful lives and residual values of the Oasis-class ships. Following a review of the estimate, considering the intended use of the vessel and assessment of the estimated lives of component assets forming the Oasis class ships, we concluded a change to the estimated lives and residual values of Oasis class ships was required. Effective fourth quarter of 2019, we revised the estimated useful lives and residual values of the Oasis-class ships from 30 years with a 15% residual value to 35 years with a 10% residual value. The change in the estimated useful lives and residual values was accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimate. For further information regarding this change in accounting estimate, refer to Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.We use the deferral method to account for drydocking costs. Under the deferral method, drydocking costs incurred are deferred and charged to expense on a straight-line basis over the period to the next scheduled drydock, which we estimate to be a period of thirty to sixty months based on the vessel\\'s age as required by Class. Deferred drydock costs consist of the costs to drydock the vessel and other costs incurred in connection with the drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessel\\'s Class certification. Class certification is necessary in order for our cruise ships to be flagged in a specific country, obtain liability insurance and legally operate as passenger cruise ships. The activities associated with those drydocking costs cannot be performed while the vessel is in service and, as such, are done during a drydock as a planned major maintenance activity. The significant deferred drydock costs consist of hauling and wharfage services provided by the drydock facility, hull inspection and related activities (e.g., scraping, pressure cleaning, bottom painting), maintenance to steering propulsion, thruster equipment and ballast 40Table of Contentstanks, port services such as tugs, pilotage and line handling, and freight associated with these items. We perform a detailed analysis of the various activities performed for each drydock and only defer those costs that are directly related to planned major maintenance activities necessary to maintain Class. The costs deferred are related to activities not otherwise routinely periodically performed to maintain a vessel\\'s designed and intended operating capability. Repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred.We use judgment when estimating the period between drydocks, which can result in adjustments to the estimated amortization of drydock costs. If the vessel is disposed of before the next drydock, the remaining balance in deferred drydock is written-off to the gain or loss upon disposal of vessel in the period in which the sale takes place. We also use judgment when identifying costs incurred during a drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessel\\'s Class certification as compared to those costs attributable to repairs and maintenance which are expensed as incurred. We believe we have made reasonable estimates for ship accounting purposes. However, should certain factors or circumstances cause us to revise our estimates of ship useful lives or projected residual values, depreciation expense could be materially higher or lower. If circumstances cause us to change our assumptions in making determinations as to whether ship improvements should be capitalized, the amounts we expense each year as repairs and maintenance costs could increase, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense. If we had reduced our estimated average ship useful life by one year, depreciation expense for 2019 would have increased by approximately $129.3 million. If our ships were estimated to have no residual value, depreciation expense for 2019 would have increased by approximately $325.1 million.Business CombinationsOn July 31, 2018, we acquired a 66.7% equity stake in Silversea Cruises for $1.02 billion in cash and contingent consideration. Refer to Note 3. Business Combination to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information on the acquisition.We account for business combinations in accordance with ASC 805,\\xa0Business Combinations, by applying the acquisition method of accounting. The\\xa0acquisition\\xa0method of accounting requires that we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and the noncontrolling interest, if any, at their respective fair values at the\\xa0acquisition\\xa0date. Goodwill is recognized as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Significant estimates and assumptions are made by management to value such assets and liabilities based on third party valuations such as appraisals or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques. Although we believe that those estimates and assumptions are reasonable and appropriate, they are inherently uncertain and subject to change. If during the measurement period (not to exceed one year), additional information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the\\xa0acquisition\\xa0date related to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we may adjust our estimates to account for subsequent adjustments to the provisional amounts recognized at the\\xa0acquisition\\xa0date, resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill associated with the business acquired.Uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a business combination as of the acquisition date. We continue to collect information and reevaluate these estimates and assumptions quarterly. We will record any adjustments to our preliminary estimates to goodwill, provided that we are within the one-year measurement period. Our purchase price measurement period for the Silversea Cruises acquisition was closed during 2019.Any contingent consideration is estimated\\xa0at fair value at the acquisition\\xa0date. Liability-classified contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings until the contingent consideration is settled.Valuation of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Long-Lived AssetsWe review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or, when events or circumstances dictate, more frequently. The impairment review for goodwill consists of a qualitative assessment of whether it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit\\'s fair value is less than its carrying amount, and if necessary, a two-step goodwill impairment test. Factors to consider when performing the qualitative assessment include general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, changes in forecasted operating results, changes in fuel prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. If the qualitative assessment demonstrates 41Table of Contentsthat it is more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, it is not necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. We may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to step one, for any reporting unit, in any period. On a periodic basis, we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed to step one to corroborate the results of recent years\\' qualitative assessments. We can resume the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any subsequent period. When performing the two-step goodwill impairment test, the fair value of the reporting unit is determined and compared to the carrying value of the net assets allocated to the reporting unit. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model. The estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected revenues, operating costs, marketing, selling and administrative expenses, interest rates, ship additions and retirements as well as assumptions regarding the cruise vacation industry\\'s competitive environment and general economic and business conditions, among other factors. The principal assumptions we use in the discounted cash flow model are projected operating results, weighted-average cost of capital, and terminal value. The discounted cash flow model uses the most current projected operating results for the upcoming fiscal year as a base. To that base, we add future years\\' cash flows assuming multiple revenue and expense scenarios that reflect the impact of different global economic environments beyond the base year on the reporting unit. We discount the projected cash flows using rates specific to the reporting unit based on its weighted-average cost of capital. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no further analysis or write-down of goodwill is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its net assets, the implied fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all its underlying assets and liabilities, including both recognized and unrecognized tangible and intangible assets, based on their fair value. If necessary, goodwill is then written down to its implied fair value.The impairment review for indefinite-life intangible assets can be performed using a qualitative or quantitative impairment assessment. The quantitative assessment consists of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount. We estimate the fair value of these assets using a discounted cash flow model and various valuation methods depending on the nature of the intangible asset, such as the relief-from-royalty method for trademarks and trade names. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. If the fair value exceeds its carrying amount, the indefinite-life intangible asset is not considered impaired. Other intangible assets assigned finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Refer to Note 6. Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data for further information on indefinite-life intangible assets.We review our ships and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate, based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows, that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable. We evaluate asset impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The lowest level for which we maintain identifiable cash flows that are independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities is at the ship level for our ships and, prior to the sale of the aircraft, at the aggregated asset group level for our aircraft. If estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset, an impairment charge is recognized to the extent its carrying value exceeds fair value.We estimate fair value based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If active markets are not available, we base fair value on independent appraisals, sales price negotiations and projected future cash flows discounted at a rate estimated by management to be commensurate with the business risk. Quoted market prices are often not available for individual reporting units and for indefinite-life intangible assets. Accordingly, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit and an indefinite-life intangible asset using an expected present value technique.Royal Caribbean InternationalDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, we performed a qualitative assessment of the Royal Caribbean International reporting unit. Based on our qualitative assessment, we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of the Royal Caribbean International reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and thus, we did not proceed to the two-step goodwill impairment test. No indicators of impairment exist primarily because the reporting unit\\'s fair value has consistently exceeded its carrying value by a significant margin and forecasts of operating results expected to be generated by the reporting unit appear sufficient to support its carrying value. As of 42Table of ContentsDecember\\xa031, 2019, the carrying amount of goodwill attributable to our Royal Caribbean reporting unit was $299.2 million.Silversea CruisesThe goodwill for the Silversea Cruises reporting unit was recorded at fair value at July 31, 2018, the acquisition date. Refer to Note 3. Business Combination to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data for further information on the Silversea Cruises acquisition. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we performed a qualitative assessment of the Silversea Cruises reporting unit. Based on our qualitative assessment, we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of the Silversea Cruises reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and thus, we did not proceed to the two-step goodwill impairment test. No indicators of impairment exist primarily because forecasts of operating results expected to be generated by the reporting unit appear sufficient to support its carrying value. As of December\\xa031, 2019, the carrying amount of goodwill attributable to our Silversea Cruises reporting unit was $1.1 billion. The indefinite-life intangible asset related to the Silversea Cruises trade name acquired in the Silversea Cruises acquisition was recorded at fair value at July 31, 2018, the acquisition date.  During the fourth quarter of 2019, we performed a qualitative assessment of the Silversea Cruises trade name. As a result of the assessment performed no impairment charge was recorded related to trade name intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the carrying amount of indefinite-life intangible assets was $352.3 million and $351.7 million, respectively, which primarily relates to the Silversea Cruises trade name acquired in the Silversea Cruises acquisition.Derivative InstrumentsWe enter into various forward, swap and option contracts to manage our interest rate exposure and to limit our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. These instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and the vast majority are designated as hedges. We also use non-derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of our net investment in our foreign operations and investments. Although certain of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify or are not accounted for under hedge accounting, we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. We account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with authoritative guidance. Refer to Note\\xa02. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note\\xa018. Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments to our consolidated financial statements under Item\\xa08. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on related authoritative guidance, the Company\\'s hedging programs and derivative financial instruments.On a regular basis, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate and fuel swaps and options with third-party institutions in over-the-counter markets. We estimate the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps using expected future cash flows based on the instruments\\' contract terms and published forward prices for foreign currency exchange and interest rates. We value floors which are embedded within our interest rate swaps using standard option pricing models with inputs based on the options’ contract terms, such as exercise price and maturity, and readily available market data, such as forward interest rates and interest rate volatility. We apply present value techniques and LIBOR or EURIBOR-based discount rates to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments.We estimate the fair value of our fuel swaps using expected future cash flows based on the swaps\\' contract terms and forward prices. We derive forward prices from published forward fuel curves which in turn are based on actual market transactions and published price quotes for similar assets. We apply present value techniques and LIBOR-based discount rates to convert the expected future cash flows to the current fair value of the instruments. We also corroborate our fair value estimates using valuations provided by our counterparties.We adjust the valuation of our derivative financial instruments to incorporate credit risk.We believe it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate and fuel swaps and options would be derived from other appropriate valuation models using similar assumptions, inputs or conditions suggested by actual historical experience.43Table of ContentsContingencies—LitigationOn an ongoing basis, we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us. While it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions, we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries, if any, which are recorded as assets when recoverability is probable. We accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries, it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made. SeasonalityOur revenues are seasonal based on demand for cruises. Demand is strongest for cruises during the Northern Hemisphere\\'s summer months and holidays. In order to mitigate the impact of the winter weather in the Northern Hemisphere and to capitalize on the summer season in the Southern Hemisphere, our brands have focused on deployment to the Caribbean, Asia and Australia during that period.Financial PresentationDescription of Certain Line ItemsRevenuesOur revenues are comprised of the following:•Passenger ticket revenues, which consist of revenue recognized from the sale of passenger tickets and the sale of air transportation to and from our ships; and•Onboard and other revenues, which consist primarily of revenues from the sale of goods and/or services onboard our ships not included in passenger ticket prices, cancellation fees, sales of vacation protection insurance, pre- and post-cruise tours and fees for operating certain port facilities. Onboard and other revenues also include revenues we receive from independent third party concessionaires that pay us a percentage of their revenues in exchange for the right to provide selected goods and/or services onboard our ships, as well as revenues received for our bareboat charter, procurement and management related services we perform on behalf of our unconsolidated affiliates.Cruise Operating ExpensesOur cruise operating expenses are comprised of the following:•Commissions, transportation and other expenses, which consist of those costs directly associated with passenger ticket revenues, including travel agent commissions, air and other transportation expenses, port costs that vary with passenger head counts and related credit card fees;•Onboard and other expenses, which consist of the direct costs associated with onboard and other revenues, including the costs of products sold onboard our ships, vacation protection insurance premiums, costs associated with pre- and post-cruise tours and related credit card fees as well as the minimal costs associated with concession revenues, as the costs are mostly incurred by third-party concessionaires  and costs incurred for the procurement and management related services we perform on behalf of our unconsolidated affiliates;•Payroll and related expenses, which consist of costs for shipboard personnel (costs associated with our shoreside personnel are included in Marketing, selling and administrative expenses);•Food expenses, which include food costs for both guests and crew;•Fuel expenses, which include fuel and related delivery, storage and emission consumable costs and the financial impact of fuel swap agreements; and44Table of Contents•Other operating expenses, which consist primarily of operating costs such as repairs and maintenance, port costs that do not vary with passenger head counts, vessel related insurance, entertainment and gains and/or losses related to the sale of our ships, if any. We do not allocate payroll and related expenses, food expenses, fuel expenses or other operating expenses to the expense categories attributable to passenger ticket revenues or onboard and other revenues since they are incurred to provide the total cruise vacation experience.Selected Operational and Financial MetricsWe utilize a variety of operational and financial metrics which are defined below to evaluate our performance and financial condition. As discussed in more detail herein, certain of these metrics are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided along with the related GAAP financial measures as we believe they provide useful information to investors as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Program refers to the multi-year program designed to communicate and motivate employees to work towards company specific goals.  The program includes five goals by 2025: delivering $20.00 adjusted earnings per share; further reducing the company’s carbon footprint by 25% against a 2019 base; delivering strong returns on invested capital; and continuing to improve on record guest satisfaction and employee engagement metrics. These goals have been put in place to focus our leadership on achieving outsized improvements in our performance going forward and are purposely aspirational. The strategies that we will employ to achieve the goals of the program are consistent with our ongoing operating strategies as listed in the Operating Strategies section. During the six-year time horizon of this program, there are many factors that will impact our ability to achieve these ambitious goals. In particular, our goal of reducing our carbon footprint by 25% will be challenging and will depend on our ability to take aggressive steps including the use of new technologies that have not yet been developed or proven. Adjusted Earnings per Share (\"Adjusted EPS\") represents Adjusted Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. divided by weighted average shares outstanding or by diluted weighted average shares outstanding, as applicable. We believe that this non-GAAP measure is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis.Adjusted Net Income represents net income less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis. For the periods presented, these items included (i) costs, net of insurance recoveries, related to the Grand Bahama drydock structure incident involving Oasis of the Seas; (ii) our equity share of the write-off of the Grand Bahama drydock and other incidental expenses by Grand Bahama; (iii) the noncontrolling interest adjustment to exclude the impact of the contractual accretion requirements associated with the put option held by Heritage Cruise Holding Ltd.\\'s (previously known as  Silversea Cruises Group Ltd.) noncontrolling interest; (iv) the change in fair value in the contingent consideration related to the Silversea Cruises acquisition; (v) a loss on the early extinguishment of debt related to the repayment of certain loans; (vi) the amortization of the Silversea Cruises intangible assets resulting from the acquisition; (vii) integration costs related to the Silversea Cruises acquisition; (viii) transaction costs related to the Silversea Cruises acquisition; (ix) restructuring  charges incurred in relation to the reorganization of our international sales and marketing structure and other initiatives; (x) the impairment loss and other costs related to the exit of our tour operations business; (xi) the impairment loss related to Skysea Holding; and (xii) the impact of the change in accounting principle related to the recognition of stock-based compensation expense from the graded attribution method to the straight-line attribution method for time-based stock awards. Available Passenger Cruise Days (\"APCD\") is our measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period, which excludes canceled cruise days and drydock days. We use this measure to perform capacity and rate analysis to identify our main non-capacity drivers that cause our cruise revenue and expenses to vary.Gross Cruise Costs represent the sum of total cruise operating expenses plus marketing, selling and administrative expenses.  For the periods presented, Gross Cruise Costs exclude (i) restructuring  charges incurred 45Table of Contentsin relation to the reorganization of our international sales and marketing structure and other  initiatives; (ii) transaction costs related to the Silversea Cruises acquisition; (iii) integration costs related to the Silversea Cruises acquisition; (iv) the impairment loss and other costs related to the exit of our tour operations business; and (v) the impact of the change in accounting principle related to the recognition of stock-based compensation expense from the graded attribution method to the straight-line attribution method for time-based stock awards, which were included within Marketing, selling and administrative expenses.Gross Yields represent total revenues per APCD.Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel represent Gross Cruise Costs excluding commissions, transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses and, in the case of Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel, fuel expenses (each of which is described above under the Description of Certain Line Items heading). In measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income, we believe changes in Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance. A reconciliation of historical Gross Cruise Costs to Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel is provided below under Results of Operations. Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel exclude the costs, net of insurance recoveries, related to the Grand Bahama drydock structure incident involving Oasis of the Seas. Net Revenues represent total revenues less commissions, transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses (each of which is described above under the Description of Certain Line Items heading). Net Yields represent Net Revenues per APCD. We utilize Net Revenues and Net Yields to manage our business on a day-to-day basis as we believe that they are the most relevant measures of our pricing performance because they reflect the cruise revenues earned by us net of our most significant variable costs, which are commissions, transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses. A reconciliation of historical Gross Yields to Net Yields is provided below under Results of Operations. Occupancy, in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice, is calculated by dividing Passenger Cruise Days by APCD. A percentage in excess of 100% indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins.Passenger Cruise Days represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises.We believe Net Yields, Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel are our most relevant non-GAAP financial measures. However, a significant portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar. Because our reporting currency is the United States dollar, the value of these revenues and expenses can be affected by changes in currency exchange rates. Although such changes in local currency prices are just one of many elements impacting our revenues and expenses, they can be an important element. For this reason, we also monitor Net Yields, Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel as if the current period\\'s currency exchange rates had remained constant with the comparable prior period\\'s rates, or on a \"Constant Currency\" basis.It should be emphasized that Constant Currency is primarily used for comparing short-term changes and/or projections. Changes in guest sourcing and shifting the amount of purchases between currencies can change the impact of the purely currency-based fluctuations.The use of certain significant non-GAAP measures, such as Net Yields, Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel, allows us to perform capacity and rate analysis to separate the impact of known capacity changes from other less predictable changes which affect our business. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide expanded insight to measure revenue and cost performance in addition to the standard GAAP based financial measures. There are no specific rules or regulations for determining non-GAAP and Constant Currency measures, and as such, they may not be comparable to other companies within the industry. We have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of (i) projected Total revenues to projected Net Revenues, (ii) projected Gross Yields to projected Net Yields, (iii) projected Gross Cruise Costs to projected Net Cruise Costs and projected Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel and (iv) projected Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Earnings per Share to projected Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings per Share because preparation of meaningful GAAP projections of Total revenues, Gross Yields, Gross Cruise Costs, Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Earnings per Share would require unreasonable effort. Due to 46Table of Contentssignificant uncertainty, we are unable to predict, without unreasonable effort, the future movement of foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and interest rates inclusive of our related hedging programs.  In addition, we are unable to determine the future impact of restructuring expenses or other non-core business related gains and losses which may result from strategic initiatives. These items are uncertain and could be material to our results of operations in accordance with GAAP. Due to this uncertainty, we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful.47Table of ContentsExecutive OverviewBy all accounts, 2019 was another year of very strong performance. We introduced three new vessels - Spectrum of the Seas, Celebrity Flora, and TUI Cruises Mein Schiff 2, launched a very successful Perfect Day destination at Coco Cay, modernized six ships and implemented Excalibur, our digital transformation platform, on most of the fleet. In addition, we continued to find efficiencies, implement synergies and reduce costs, while at the same time, remained focused on strategic investments in areas that will boost revenue.Our 2019 net income was $1.9 billion, or $8.95 per diluted share, compared to $1.8 billion, or $8.56 per diluted share, in 2018. Adjusted Net Income for 2019 was $2.0 billion, or $9.54 per diluted share, compared to $1.9 billion, or $8.86 per diluted share, in 2018. Adjusted EPS for 2019, on a diluted basis, represents an 8% increase in earnings compared to 2018. We were able to achieve these results despite the dry-dock incident in the Grand Bahama shipyard, the cancellation of cruises to Cuba beginning in June of this year and an unusual hurricane season, all of which negatively impacted the company’s adjusted earnings per share for the year by approximately $0.80. Total revenues increased $1.5 billion in 2019 to $11.0 billion, compared to $9.5 billion in 2018, primarily driven by increases in both ticket and onboard yields. During 2019, our Gross Yields and Net Yields increased by 8.0%, on a Constant-Currency basis, marking the tenth consecutive year of revenue growth.  The addition of new vessels to the fleet, the consolidation of Silversea Cruises, Perfect Day at CocoCay and our Miami terminal operation also contributed to our year-over-year revenue growth. Onboard revenue and Net onboard revenue growth came from a variety of revenue enhancing initiatives, including beverage package sales and promotions, gaming initiatives and new strategies and promotions on our shore excursions, specialty restaurants and Internet services.Cruise operating expenses increased $801.0 million in 2019 to $6.1 billion from $5.3 billion in 2018. Adjusting for capacity, our Gross Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel increased by 8.7% and 11.4%, respectively, on a Constant Currency basis compared to 2018 driven primarily by the consolidation of Silversea Cruises, our new operations of Perfect Day at CocoCay and our terminal operation in Miami. The Company remains focused on improving returns for our shareholders. In 2019, we bought back $100.0 million in shares of common stock and have $600.0 million remaining under our $1.0 billion share repurchase program that was announced in May 2018. Consistent with our earnings growth, we also announced a 11% increase to our common stock dividend, our seventh consecutive year with a dividend increase.Perfect Day at CocoCay is the first of our Perfect Day Island Collection of next-level private destinations. The island debuted a combination of first-of-their-kind thrills and one-of-a-kind ways to chill that significantly change what is possible in a vacation destination. The island features the tallest waterslide in North America, the Up and Away helium balloon, and the Caribbean’s largest wave pool. The year 2020 has started off challenging as we address the impact of the recent coronavirus outbreak on our operations. Prior to the outbreak, our sailings in China were trending particularly well both in terms of rate and volume. Our itineraries in China were expected to represent 6% and 4% of our full year and first quarter 2020 capacity, respectively. The travel restrictions and other measures taken by China and other countries to contain the disease have resulted in the cancellation of an increasing number of our cruises in the region. We have also implemented several measures restricting the boarding of certain at-risk guests and crew on our ships. These and other concerns and restrictions relating to the coronavirus outbreak are having an impact on the demand for cruises and causing travel restrictions, guest cancellations, an unavailability of ports and/or destinations, ship redeployments and an inability to source our crew, provisions or supplies from certain places. All of these issues are having and are likely to continue to have a material impact on our bookings, operations and our overall financial performance. However, given the fluidity and uncertainty of this situation, we are unable to predict the full financial impact that this incident will have on our operations and financial condition, including what our yields and earnings for 2020 will be (see Outlook).In 2020, we expect our capacity to increase 4.8% year-over-year as we add Odyssey of the Seas and  Celebrity Apex as well as two Silversea vessels, Silver Origin and Silver Moon, to the fleet. We’ve slightly 48Table of Contentsincreased our capacity in the Caribbean to over 50% of our total capacity in 2020, driven by the inaugural winter seasons of Odyssey of the Seas and Celebrity Apex. Our European itineraries will account for 17% of our 2020 capacity with the year-over-year increase driven by the timing of drydocks and the addition of Celebrity Apex and Silver Moon. Excluding the impact of the recent coronavirus outbreak, we expect another year of total revenue and net yield growth driven by our new ships, strong demand for our core products and continued growth from our onboard revenue areas. In addition, we recently announced our  program which presents specific goals to be achieved by 2025: delivering $20.00 adjusted earnings per share; further reducing the company’s carbon footprint by 25%; delivering strong returns on invested capital; and continuing to improve on record guest satisfaction and employee engagement metrics. Our management team is goal motivated and our aim, through this program, is to establish clear, simple, and ambitious targets that will motivate our people and drive superior results. Adopting these clear and simple  goals will help guide our everyday decision-making to focus on People, Profits and Planet. 49Table of ContentsResults of OperationsFor reporting purposes, we include Silversea Cruises’ results of operations on a three-month reporting lag from October 1, 2018 through September\\xa030, 2019 in our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 and from the date of acquisition through September 30, 2018 in our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018. Refer to Note 1. General and Note 3. Business Combinations to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information on the three-month reporting lag and the Silversea Cruises acquisition.In addition to the items discussed above under \"Executive Overview,\" significant items for 2019 include:•Our Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Adjusted Net Income for the year ended December\\xa031, 2019 was $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion, or $8.95 and $9.54 per share on a diluted basis, respectively, as compared to Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and Adjusted Net Income of $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion, or $8.56 and $8.86 per share on a diluted basis, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018.•Total revenues, excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency rates, increased by $1.6 billion for the year ended December\\xa031, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to an increase in capacity and an increase in ticket prices and onboard spending on a per passenger basis, which are further discussed below.•The effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our passenger ticket and onboard and other revenue transactions, denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, resulted in a decrease in total revenues of $127.4 million for the year ended December\\xa031, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.•Total cruise operating expenses, excluding the effect of changes in foreign currency rate, increased by $837.5 million for the year ended December\\xa031, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to an increase in capacity, which is further discussed below. •The effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our cruise operating expenses, denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, resulted in a decrease in total operating expenses of $36.9 million for the year ended December\\xa031, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018.•Effective June 5th, 2019, we stopped sailings to Cuba as the U.S government rescinded authorized travel to Cuba under the People-to-People program and prohibited travel to Cuba via cruise ships. The estimated negative impact resulting from this regulatory change, primarily due to changes in itineraries, is approximately $0.29 per share on a diluted basis to our Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.•The estimated negative impact resulting from the Grand Bahama drydock structure incident involving Oasis of the Seas, net of insurance recoveries and including our share of the write-off of the related drydock by Grand Bahama, is approximately $0.36 per share on a diluted basis to our Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.•The estimated negative impact resulting from 2019 hurricane-related disruptions was approximately $0.15 per share on a diluted basis to our Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.•In April 2019, we entered into and drew in full on an unsecured three-year term loan agreement in the amount of $1.0 billion. Proceeds of this loan were used to repay the $700 million 364-day loan due July 2019 related to the acquisition of Silversea Cruises and the remaining balance of the unsecured term loan originally incurred in 2010 to purchase Allure of the Seas. The repayment of these loans resulted in a total loss on the extinguishment of debt of $6.3 million, which was recognized within Other (expense) income within our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).50Table of ContentsOther items for 2019 include:•In February 2019, TUI Cruises, our 50% joint venture, took delivery of a new Mein Schiff 2 and the existing Mein Schiff 2 was renamed Mein Schiff Herz.•During the second quarter of 2019, we took delivery of Spectrum of the Seas and Celebrity Flora. To finance the purchases, we borrowed $908.0 million and €80.0 million, or approximately $89.8 million based on the exchange rate at December\\xa031, 2019, respectively, under previously committed unsecured term loans. Refer to Note 9. Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 1. Financial Statements for further information. Additionally, Spectrum of the Seas and Celebrity Flora entered service in April 2019 and at the end of June 2019, respectively.•In April 2019, we amended our $1.4 billion unsecured revolving credit facility due in 2020 to extend the termination date through April 2024, increase the facility size to $1.7 billion and reduce pricing. Refer to Note 9. Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 1. Financial Statements for further information.•In April 2019, Silversea Cruises entered into an agreement with Meyer Werft to build two ships of a new generation, known as the Evolution-class.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information on the change in an accounting principle.55Table of ContentsOutlook The widely reported coronavirus outbreak and efforts by China and other countries to move aggressively to  contain the spread of the disease have adversely impacted our business, including a drop in demand for cruises, guest cancellations, travel restrictions,  an unavailability of ports and/or destinations, cruise cancellations, ship redeployments and an inability to source our crew, provisions or supplies from certain places. We have implemented several measures to protect guest and crew, including denying boarding to those that have travelled from, to or through mainland China or Hong Kong in the past 15 days and performing mandatory specialized health screenings on at-risk guest and crew. These measures have caused us to cancel cruise bookings or restrict certain guests from booking our cruises. We are assessing the developments constantly and will update our protective measures as needed.As a result of these measures, we have now cancelled 30 sailings in Southeast Asia and modified several itineraries in the region which overall have an estimated impact of $0.90 per share to our 2020 financial performance. If the company were to cancel all of its remaining sailings in Asia through the end of April, it would impact our 2020 financial performance by an additional $0.30.There are still too many variables and uncertainties regarding the impact of this outbreak on our business in Asia and elsewhere to reasonably forecast the full impact on our business, including what our yields and earnings for 2020 will be. These concerns and restrictions over the outbreak are impacting our bookings and are having, and are likely to continue to have, a material impact on our overall financial performance. The company does not make predictions about fuel pricing, interest rates or currency exchange rates but does provide guidance about its future business activities. On February\\xa04, 2020, we announced the following initial full year and first quarter 2020 guidance based on the then current fuel pricing, interest rates and currency exchange rates. Given the fluidity of the circumstances related to the recent coronavirus and the actions being taken to contain its spread, the following 2020 guidance does not include any financial impact related to the coronavirus outbreak:Full Year 2020 As ReportedConstant CurrencyNet Yields2.5% to 4.5%2.25% to 4.25%Net Cruise Costs per APCD1.75% to 2.25%1.75% to 2.25%Net Cruise Costs per APCD, excluding Fuel1.75% to 2.25%1.75% to 2.25%Capacity Change4.8%\\xa0\\xa0Depreciation and Amortization$1,376 to $1,392 millionInterest Expense, net$368 to $384 millionFuel Consumption (metric tons)1,534,300\\xa0\\xa0Fuel Expenses$744 millionPercent Hedged (fwd consumption)54%\\xa0\\xa010% change in Fuel Prices$37 million1% Change in Currency$21 million1% Change in Net Yields$91 million1% Change in NCC x Fuel$48 million100 basis pt.

Accordingly, except for the impact of the recent coronavirus outbreak, described above, fuel prices and foreign currency exchange rates, our forecast remains essentially unchanged.Volatility in foreign currency exchange rates affects the United States dollar value of our earnings. Based on our highest net exposure for each quarter and the full year 2020, the top five foreign currencies are ranked below. For example, the Australian Dollar is the most impactful currency in the first and fourth quarters of 2020.

Passenger ticket revenues increased by $1.1 billion, or 15.7% from 2018. The increase was primarily due to:•an 7.8% increase in capacity, which increased Passenger ticket revenues by $565.0 million, primarily due to the additions of Spectrum of the Seas in the second quarter of 2019, Symphony of the Seas in the second quarter of 2018,  Azamara Pursuit in the third quarter of 2018, Celebrity Edge in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the acquisition of Silversea Cruises in the second half of 2018, partially offset by a significant increase in dry dock days in 2019 compared to 2018 and the negative impact of canceled and modified sailings resulting from the dry-dock incident in the Grand Bahama shipyard and hurricane-related disruptions during 2019.•an increase of $614.0 million in ticket prices primarily driven by the addition of Spectrum of the Seas, Symphony of the Seas, Azamara Pursuit, Celebrity Edge and the Silversea Cruises fleet, and the higher pricing on our Caribbean and Asia/Pacific sailings, net of the negative impact to our ticket price on a per passenger basis resulting from itinerary changes related to the travel restrictions to Cuba.The increase in Passenger ticket revenues was partially offset by the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar of $(111.1) million.The remaining 28.3% of 2019 total revenues was comprised of Onboard and other revenues, which increased $392.5 million, or 14.5%. The increase in Onboard and other revenues was primarily due to:•a $118.4 million increase in onboard revenue attributable to higher spending on a per passenger basis primarily due to shore excursions, Perfect Day at CocoCay, specialty restaurants, internet services, beverage package sales and promotions, gaming initiatives and new programs and activities offered to our guests; •a $193.6 million increase attributable to the 7.8% increase in capacity noted above, net of the negative impact of canceled and modified sailings resulting from the dry-dock incident in the Grand Bahama shipyard and hurricane-related disruptions in 2019; and•a $79.7 million increase in other revenues primarily due to revenue associated with our new cruise terminal at PortMiami and cancellation fees associated with non-refundable deposits and higher pricing.Onboard and other revenues included concession revenues of $363.8 million in 2019 and $339.0 million in 2018.Cruise Operating Expenses Total cruise operating expenses for 2019 increased $800.6 million, or 15.2%, to $6.1 billion in 2019 from $5.3 billion in 2018.\\xa0The increase was primarily due to:•the 7.8% increase in capacity noted above, which increased cruise operating expenses by $433.3 million;•a $367.3 million increase in total cruise operating expenses, excluding capacity, was primarily due to the addition of Silversea Cruises to our fleet in the second half of 2018 as well as incidental costs related to the collapse of the drydock structure at the Grand Bahama Shipyard involving Oasis of the Seas, expenses associated with operating Perfect Day at CocoCay and our new cruise terminal at PortMiami. The increase in Cruise operating expenses was partially offset by:•a $47.0 million decrease in fuel expenses, excluding the impact of capacity. Our cost of fuel (net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements) for 2019 decreased 11% per metric ton compared to 2018; and 58Table of Contents•a favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to costs denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar of $37.0 million.Marketing, Selling and Administrative ExpensesMarketing, selling and administrative expenses for 2019 increased $256.1 million, or 19.7%, to $1.6 billion from $1.3 billion in 2018. The increase was primarily due to the addition of Silversea Cruises in the second half of 2018, higher spending on advertisement and media promotions and an increase in payroll and benefits expense primarily driven by an increase in headcount and higher stock price year over year related to our performance share awards. Additionally, 2019 includes expenses associated with Hurricane Dorian relief efforts, which did not occur in 2018.Marketing, selling and administrative expenses for 2019 and 2018 include transaction costs  incurred by us related to the Silversea Cruises acquisition of $1.2 million and $31.8 million, respectively.Depreciation and Amortization ExpensesDepreciation and amortization expenses for 2019 increased $212.2 million, or 20.5%, to $1.2 billion. The increase was primarily due to the addition of Spectrum of the Seas in the second quarter of 2019, Symphony of the Seas in the second quarter of 2018, Azamara Pursuit in the third quarter of 2018, Celebrity Edge in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the addition of Silversea Cruises to our fleet in the second half of 2018.  Additionally,  to a lesser extent, the increase is also attributable to new shipboard additions associated with our ship upgrade projects and additions related to our shoreside projects. Other Income (Expense)Interest expense, net of interest capitalized, increased $74.8 million, or 22.4%, to $408.5 million in 2019 from $333.7 million in 2018. The increase was primarily due to a higher average debt level in 2019 compared to 2018 attributable to the financing of our newbuilds and our acquisition of Silversea Cruises in the second half of 2018 and to  lesser extent, higher interest rates in 2019 compared to 2018.Equity investment income increased $20.2 million, or 9.6%, to $231.0 million in 2019 from $210.8 million in 2018 primarily due to an increase in income from various equity investments, partially offset by equity investment losses from Grand Bahama as a result of a drydock write-off in 2019.Other expense was $24.5 million in 2019 compared to Other income of $11.1 million in 2018. The increase in  expense of $35.6 million was mainly due to higher taxes resulting from a full year of Silversea Cruises activity reported in 2019 and higher U.S. taxable income in 2019; and an increase in the fair value of contingent consideration related to the Silversea Cruises acquisition. In addition, a gain of $21.8 million was reported in 2018  related to the recognition of the remaining balance of a deferred gain from the sale of Celebrity Galaxy to TUI Cruises in March 2009. In April 2018, TUI Cruises sold this ship to an affiliate of TUI AG, resulting in the recognition of the remaining balance of the deferred gain. Other income in 2018 also includes a gain of $13.7 million related to the sale of our remaining equity interest in a travel agency business that we sold in 2015. The gains in 2018 were partially offset by an impairment charge of $23.3 million to write down our investment balance, debt facility and other receivables due from Skysea Holding to their net realizable value in 2018.  For further information on the deferred gain recognized and impairment charge, refer to Note 8. Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements under Item\\xa08.

The decrease in loss of $123.5 million was primarily due to the Loss on cash flow derivative hedges in 2019 of $151.3 million compared to the Loss on cash flow derivative hedges of $286.9 million in 2018. The decrease of $135.5 million in Loss on cash flow derivative hedges in 2019 was primarily due to an increase in the fair value of our fuel swap instruments held in 2019 compared to 2018.Year Ended December\\xa031, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December\\xa031, 2017 In this section, references to 2018 refer to the year ended December\\xa031, 2018 and references to 2017 refer to the year ended December\\xa031, 2017.RevenuesTotal revenues for 2018 increased $716.0 million, or 8.2%, to $9.5 billion from $8.8 billion in 2017.Passenger ticket revenues comprised 71.5% of our 2018 total revenues. Passenger ticket revenues increased by $479.5 million, or 7.6% from 2017.

Additionally, 2017 includes the impact of canceled sailings from hurricane-related disruptions which did not recur in 2018; •an increase of $216.3 million in ticket prices primarily driven by higher pricing on Asia/Pacific and Europe sailings and the increase to our ticket price on a per passenger basis due to the addition of Symphony of the Seas, Azamara Pursuit, Celebrity Edge and the Silversea Cruises fleet, partially offset by a decrease in pricing on Caribbean sailings; and•the favorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar of approximately $7.8 million.The remaining 28.5% of 2018 total revenues was comprised of Onboard and other revenues, which increased $236.5 million, or 9.6%. The increase in Onboard and other revenues was primarily due to:•a $112.5 million increase in onboard revenue attributable to higher spending on a per passenger basis primarily due to our revenue enhancing initiatives, including beverage package sales and promotions, gaming initiatives, and new strategies and promotions on our shore excursion, specialty restaurant and Internet services;  •a $97.4 million increase attributable to the 4.0% increase in capacity noted above; and•a $23.2 million increase in other revenue primarily due to cancellation fees mostly associated with non-refundable deposit promotions and the addition of Silversea Cruises.Onboard and other revenues included concession revenues of $339.0 million in 2018 and $326.5 million in 2017.Cruise Operating ExpensesTotal cruise operating expenses for 2018 decreased $365.6 million, or 7.5%, to $5.3 billion in 2018 from $4.9 billion in 2017.\\xa0The decrease was primarily due to:•the 4.0% increase in capacity noted above, which increased cruise operating expenses by $198.6 million;60Table of Contents•a $30.9 million gain recognized in 2017 resulting from the sale of Legend of the Seas, which did not recur in 2018;•a $37.3 million increase in payroll and related expenses primarily driven by Silversea Cruises\\' higher crew to passenger ratio, an increase in employee bonuses and changes in our gratuity structure;•a $23.5 million increase in air expense primarily related to the addition of Silversea Cruises and itinerary changes;•a $19.7 million increase in vessel maintenance primarily due to the timing of scheduled drydocks; and•an unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency, exchange rates related to our cruise operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar of $8.1 million.Marketing, Selling and Administrative ExpensesMarketing, selling and administrative expenses for 2018 increased $117.1 million, or 9.9%, to $1.3 billion from $1.2 billion in 2017. The increase was primarily due to transaction costs incurred by us related to the Silversea Cruises acquisition, marketing, selling and administrative expenses due to the addition of Silversea Cruises, the impairment and other costs related to the exit of our tour operations business, which occurred in 2018, and an increase in payroll and benefits expense primarily driven by an increase in headcount, partially offset by lower stock prices year over year related to our performance share awards, as well as higher spending on advertisement.Depreciation and Amortization ExpensesDepreciation and amortization expenses for 2018 increased $82.5 million, or 8.7%, to $1.0 billion. The increase was primarily due to the addition of Symphony of the Seas, Azamara Pursuit and Silversea Cruises to our fleet and, to a lesser extent, the addition of Celebrity Edge, new shipboard additions associated with our ship upgrade projects and additions related to our shoreside projects.

Other income was $11.1 million in 2018 compared to Other expense of  $5.3 million in 2017. The change of $16.4 million was mainly due to a gain of $21.8 million in 2018 related to the recognition of the remaining balance of a deferred gain from the sale of Celebrity Galaxy to TUI Cruises in March 2009.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased $237.2 million to $3.7 billion in 2019 compared to $3.5 billion in 2018. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in proceeds from customer deposits and an increase in cash receipts from onboard spending. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in dividends received from unconsolidated affiliates of $92.9 million.Net cash provided by operating activities increased $604.6 million to $3.5 billion in 2018 compared to $2.9 billion in 2017. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in proceeds from customer deposits, an increase in cash receipts from onboard spending and a decrease in fuel costs in 2018 compared to 2017. Additionally, dividends received from unconsolidated affiliates increased by $133.4 million.Net cash used in investing activities decreased $1.4 billion to $3.1 billion in 2019 compared to $4.5 billion in 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to the $916.1 million of cash paid for the acquisition of Silversea Cruises, net of cash acquired, in 2018, which did not recur in 2019 and a decrease in capital expenditures of $635.4 million due mostly to the delivery of two more ships in 2018 compared to 2019, partially offset by higher fleet  modernization costs in 2019 compared to 2018.Net cash used in investing activities increased $4.3 billion to $4.5 billion in 2018 compared to $213.6 million in 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in capital expenditures of $3.1 billion primarily due to the delivery of Symphony of the Seas and Celebrity Edge and to a lesser extent the purchase of Azamara Pursuit in 2018 compared to no ship deliveries or purchases in 2017 and $916.1 million of cash paid for the acquisition of Silversea Cruises, net of cash acquired, in 2018 as well as $230.0 million of proceeds received from the sale of property and equipment in 2017, which did not recur in 2018. Net cash used in financing activities was $670.4 million in 2019 compared to Net cash provided in financing activities of $1.2 billion in 2018. The change was primarily attributable to a decrease in debt proceeds of $5.1 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to a decrease in borrowings on our revolving credit facilities and less unsecured term loan borrowings resulting from less ship deliveries in 2019 and the financing of the acquisition of Silversea Cruises in 2018. This decrease in proceeds was partially offset by a decrease in repayments of debt of $2.9 billion and a decrease in stock repurchases of $475.5 million in 2019 compared to 2018.Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.2 billion in 2018 compared to Net cash used in financing activities of $2.7 billion in 2017. The change was primarily attributable to an increase in proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes of $4.7 billion in 2018 compared to none issued in 2017 and an increase in debt proceeds of $2.7 billion in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase in debt proceeds in 2018 was primarily due to the $1.2 billion unsecured term loan borrowed to finance Symphony of the Seas, and the $729.0 million unsecured term loan borrowed to finance Celebrity Edge, the $700.0 million unsecured term loan borrowed to finance the acquisition of Silversea Cruises, an increase in borrowings on our revolving credit facilities and the $130.0 million credit agreement.63Table of ContentsFuture Capital CommitmentsOur future capital commitments consist primarily of new ship orders. As of December\\xa031, 2019, we have two Oasis-class ships, one Quantum-class ship, and three ships of a new generation, known as our Icon-class, on order for our Royal Caribbean International brand with an aggregate capacity of approximately 32,400 berths. As of December\\xa031, 2019, we have three Edge-class ships with an aggregate capacity of approximately 9,400 berths. Additionally as of December\\xa031, 2019, we have five ships on order for our Silversea Cruises brand with an aggregate capacity of approximately 2,400 berths. Refer to Item 1. Business-Operations for further information on our ships on order. For each of these orders, we have committed financing arrangements in place covering 80% of the cost of the ship, almost all of which include sovereign financing guarantees.As of December\\xa031, 2019, the aggregate cost of our ships on order, not including any ships on order by our Partner Brands and the Silversea Cruises ships that remain contingent upon final documentation and financing, was approximately $14.8 billion, of which we had deposited $881.5 million as of such date. Approximately 65.9% of the aggregate cost was exposed to fluctuations in the Euro exchange rate at December\\xa031, 2019. (Refer to Note 18. Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments and Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data).As of December\\xa031, 2019, anticipated overall capital expenditures, based on our existing ships on order, are approximately $4.7 billion for 2020, $3.5 billion for 2021, $3.6 billion for 2022 and $2.9 billion for 2023.Contractual ObligationsAs of December\\xa031, 2019, our contractual obligations were as follows (in thousands):\\xa0Payments\\xa0due\\xa0by\\xa0period\\xa0\\xa0Less\\xa0than1-33-5More\\xa0than\\xa0Total1\\xa0yearyearsyears5\\xa0yearsOperating Activities:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Operating lease obligations(1)$938,354\\xa0\\xa0$126,234\\xa0\\xa0$217,941\\xa0\\xa0$177,057\\xa0\\xa0$417,122\\xa0\\xa0Interest on long-term debt(2)1,918,714\\xa0\\xa0348,821\\xa0\\xa0588,296\\xa0\\xa0383,167\\xa0\\xa0598,430\\xa0\\xa0Other(3)455,404\\xa0\\xa0202,879\\xa0\\xa0194,936\\xa0\\xa023,356\\xa0\\xa034,233\\xa0\\xa0Investing Activities:Ship purchase obligations(4)11,418,681\\xa0\\xa02,195,931\\xa0\\xa04,958,432\\xa0\\xa03,060,998\\xa0\\xa01,203,320\\xa0\\xa0Financing Activities:Commercial paper(5)1,434,180\\xa0\\xa01,434,180\\xa0\\xa0—\\xa0\\xa0—\\xa0\\xa0—\\xa0\\xa0Debt obligations(6)9,370,438\\xa0\\xa01,153,024\\xa0\\xa03,270,006\\xa0\\xa01,476,538\\xa0\\xa03,470,870\\xa0\\xa0Capital lease obligations(7)230,258\\xa0\\xa033,562\\xa0\\xa053,203\\xa0\\xa010,541\\xa0\\xa0132,952\\xa0\\xa0Other(8)15,008\\xa0\\xa04,841\\xa0\\xa07,406\\xa0\\xa02,761\\xa0\\xa0Total$25,781,037\\xa0\\xa0$5,499,472\\xa0\\xa0$9,290,220\\xa0\\xa0$5,134,418\\xa0\\xa0$5,856,927\\xa0\\xa0___________________________________________________________________(1)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We are obligated under noncancelable operating leases primarily for offices, warehouses and motor vehicles.

As a normal part of our business, depending on market conditions, pricing and our overall growth strategy, we continuously consider opportunities to enter into contracts for the building of additional ships. We may also consider the sale of ships or the purchase of existing ships. We continuously consider potential acquisitions and strategic alliances. If any of these were to occur, they would be financed through the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the issuance of additional shares of equity securities or through cash flows from operations.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe and TUI AG have each guaranteed the repayment by TUI Cruises of 50% of a bank loan. As of December\\xa031, 2019, the outstanding principal amount of the loan was €26.4 million, or approximately $29.7 million, based on the exchange rate at December\\xa031, 2019. The loan amortizes quarterly and is currently secured by a first mortgage on Mein Schiff Herz, previously known as Mein Schiff 2. Based on current facts and circumstances, we do not believe potential obligations under our guarantee of this bank loan are probable.TUI Cruises has entered into various ship construction and credit agreements that include certain restrictions on each of our and TUI AG\\'s ability to reduce our current ownership interest in TUI Cruises below 37.55% through May 2031.Some of the contracts that we enter into include indemnification provisions that obligate us to make payments to the counterparty if certain events occur. These contingencies generally relate to changes in taxes, increased lender capital costs and other similar costs. The indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and are entered into in the normal course of business. There are no stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and we are not able to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments, if any, under these indemnification clauses. We have not been required to make any payments under such indemnification clauses in the past and, under current circumstances, we do not believe an indemnification obligation is probable.As of December 31, 2019, other than the items described above, we are not party to any other off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interest, certain derivative instruments and variable interest entities, that either have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial position.Funding Needs and SourcesWe have significant contractual obligations of which our debt service obligations and the capital expenditures associated with our ship purchases represent our largest funding needs. As of December\\xa031, 2019, we had approximately $5.5 billion in contractual obligations due through December\\xa031, 2020 of which approximately $2.6 billion relates to debt maturities including our commercial paper notes, $348.8 million relates to interest on debt and $2.2 billion relates to progress payments on our ship orders and the final installments payable due upon the deliveries of Celebrity Apex, Silver Origin, Silver Moon and Odyssey of the Seas in 2020. We have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations, drawdowns under our available credit facilities and our commercial paper program, the incurrence of additional debt and/or the refinancing of our existing debt and the issuance of additional shares of equity securities to fund these obligations.As of December\\xa031, 2019, we had a working capital deficit of $6.8 billion, which included $1.2 billion of current portion of debt, including finance leases, and $1.4 billion of commercial paper. As of December\\xa031, 2018, we had a working capital deficit of $5.9 billion, which included $1.6 billion of current portion of debt, including finance leases and $0.8 million of commercial paper. Similar to others in our industry, we operate with a substantial working capital deficit. This deficit is mainly attributable to the fact that, under our business model, a vast majority of our passenger ticket receipts are collected in advance of the applicable sailing date. These advance passenger 65Table of Contentsreceipts remain a current liability until the sailing date. The cash generated from these advance receipts is used interchangeably with cash on hand from other sources, such as our revolving credit facilities, commercial paper and other cash from operations. The cash received as advanced receipts can be used to fund operating expenses for the applicable future sailing or otherwise, pay down our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper, invest in long term investments or any other use of cash. In addition, we have a relatively low-level of accounts receivable and rapid turnover results in a limited investment in inventories. We generate substantial cash flows from operations, and our business model, along with our unsecured revolving credit facilities, has historically allowed us to maintain this working capital deficit and still meet our operating, investing and financing needs. We expect that we will continue to have working capital deficits in the future.As of December\\xa031, 2019, we had liquidity of $1.5 billion, consisting of $243.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1.3 billion available under our unsecured credit facilities, net of our outstanding commercial paper notes. We anticipate that our cash flows from operations and our current financing arrangements, as described above, will be adequate to meet our capital expenditures and debt repayments over the next twelve-month period. As of December\\xa031, 2019, we have approximately $600.0 million that remains available for future common stock repurchase transactions under a 24-month common stock repurchase program for up to $1.0 billion authorized by our board of directors in May 2018. Repurchases under the program may be made at management\\'s discretion from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and are expected to be funded from available cash or borrowings. Refer to Note 12. Shareholders\\' Equity to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data for further information.If any person acquires ownership of more than 50% of our common stock or, subject to certain exceptions, during any 24-month period, a majority of our board of directors is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of our board of directors on the first day of such period, we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities, which we may be unable to replace on similar terms. Our public debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by a third-party acquisition of greater than 50% of our common stock coupled with a ratings downgrade. If this were to occur, it would have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations.Debt CovenantsCertain of our financing agreements contain covenants that require us, among other things, to maintain minimum net worth of at least $9.9 billion, a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.25x and limit our net debt-to-capital ratio to no more than 62.5%. The fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated by dividing net cash from operations for the past four quarters by the sum of dividend payments plus scheduled principal debt payments in excess of any new financings for the past four quarters. Our minimum net worth and maximum net debt-to-capital calculations exclude the impact of Accumulated other comprehensive loss on Total shareholders\\' equity. We were well in excess of all debt covenant requirements as of December\\xa031, 2019. The specific covenants and related definitions can be found in the applicable debt agreements, the majority of which have been previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.DividendsIn December 2019, we declared a cash dividend on our common stock of $0.78 per share which was paid in the first quarter of 2020. We declared a cash dividend on our common stock of $0.78 per share during the third quarter of 2019 which was paid in the fourth quarter of 2019. During the first and second quarters of 2019, we declared a cash dividend on our common stock of $0.70 per share which was paid in the second and third quarters of 2019, respectively. During the first quarter of 2019, we also paid a cash dividend on our common stock of $0.70 per share which was declared during the fourth quarter of 2018.66Table of ContentsItem\\xa07A.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskFinancial Instruments and OtherGeneralWe are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We try to mitigate these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments pursuant to our hedging practices and policies. The financial impact of these hedging instruments is primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged. We achieve this by closely matching the amount, term and conditions of the derivative instrument with the underlying risk being hedged. Although certain of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify or are not accounted for under hedge accounting, our objective is not to hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. (Refer to Note 18. Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.)Interest Rate Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our long-term debt obligations including future interest payments. At December\\xa031, 2019, approximately 62.1% of our long-term debt was effectively fixed as compared to 59.1% as of December\\xa031, 2018. We use interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense.Market risk associated with our long-term fixed rate debt is the potential increase in fair value resulting from a decrease in interest rates.\\xa0We use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our fixed-rate debt to a floating-rate basis to manage this risk. At December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, we maintained interest rate swap agreements on the following fixed-rate debt instruments:Debt InstrumentSwap Notional as of December 31, 2019 (In thousands)MaturityDebt Fixed RateSwap Floating Rate: LIBOR plusAll-in Swap Floating Rate as of December 31, 2019Oasis of the Seas term loan$70,000\\xa0\\xa0October 20215.41%\\xa0\\xa03.87%\\xa0\\xa05.8%\\xa0\\xa0Unsecured senior notes650,000\\xa0\\xa0November 20225.25%\\xa0\\xa03.63%\\xa0\\xa05.54%\\xa0\\xa0$720,000\\xa0\\xa0These interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges.The estimated fair value of our long-term fixed-rate debt at December\\xa031, 2019 was $5.6 billion, using quoted market prices, where available, or using the present value of expected future cash flows which incorporates risk profile. The fair value of our fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be a liability of $1.6 million as of December\\xa031, 2019, based on the present value of expected future cash flows. A hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates at December\\xa031, 2019 would increase the fair value of our hedged and unhedged long-term fixed-rate debt by approximately $266.2 million and would increase the fair value of our fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements by approximately $16.5 million.Market risk associated with our long-term floating-rate debt is the potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest rates. We use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our floating-rate debt to a fixed-rate basis to manage this risk. A hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase our forecasted 2020 interest expense by approximately $37.4 million, assuming no change in foreign currency exchange rates.   67Table of ContentsAt December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, we maintained interest rate swap agreements on the following floating-rate debt instruments:Debt InstrumentSwap Notional as of December 31, 2019 (In thousands)MaturityDebt Floating RateAll-in Swap Fixed RateCelebrity Reflection term loan$272,708\\xa0\\xa0October 2024LIBOR plus0.40%\\xa0\\xa02.85%\\xa0\\xa0Quantum of the Seas term loan428,750\\xa0\\xa0October 2026LIBOR plus1.30%\\xa0\\xa03.74%\\xa0\\xa0Anthem of the Seas term loan453,125\\xa0\\xa0April 2027LIBOR plus1.30%\\xa0\\xa03.86%\\xa0\\xa0Ovation of the Seas term loan 587,917\\xa0\\xa0April 2028LIBOR plus1.00%\\xa0\\xa03.16%\\xa0\\xa0Harmony of the Seas term loan (1)551,325\\xa0\\xa0May 2028EURIBOR plus1.15%\\xa0\\xa02.26%\\xa0\\xa0Odyssey of the Seas term loan (2)460,000\\xa0\\xa0October 2032LIBOR plus0.95%\\xa0\\xa03.20%\\xa0\\xa0$2,753,825\\xa0\\xa0___________________________________________________________________(1)\\xa0Interest rate swap agreements hedging the Euro-denominated term loan for Harmony of the Seas include EURIBOR zero-floors matching the hedged debt EURIBOR zero-floor.

The anticipated unsecured term loan for the financing of Odyssey of the Seas is expected to be drawn in October 2020. These interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges.The fair value of our floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements was estimated to be a liability of $65.4 million as of December\\xa031, 2019 based on the present value of expected future cash flows. These interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskOur primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to our ship construction contracts denominated in Euros, our foreign currency denominated debt and our international business operations. On a regular basis, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and, from time to time, we utilize cross-currency swap agreements and collar options to manage portions of the exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The estimated fair value, as of December\\xa031, 2019, of our Euro-denominated forward contracts associated with our ship construction contracts was a liability of $139.2 million, based on the present value of expected future cash flows. As of December\\xa031, 2019, the aggregate cost of our ships on order, not including ships on order by our Partner Brands and the Silversea Cruises ships that remain contingent upon final documentation and financing, was approximately $14.8 billion, of which we had deposited $881.5 million as of such date. Approximately 65.9% and 53.5% of the aggregate cost of the ships under construction was exposed to fluctuations in the Euro exchange rate at December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, respectively. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the Euro as of December\\xa031, 2019, assuming no changes in comparative interest rates, would result in a $972.2 million increase in the United States dollar cost of the foreign currency denominated ship construction contracts exposed to fluctuations in the Euro exchange rate. Our foreign currency forward contract agreements are accounted for as cash flow or net investment hedges depending on the designation of the related hedge.Our international business operations subject us to foreign currency exchange risk.  We transact business in many different foreign currencies and maintain investments in foreign operations which may expose us to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Movements in foreign currency exchange rates may affect the value of our earnings in foreign currencies and cash flows. We manage most of this exposure on a consolidated basis, which allows us to take advantage of any natural offsets. Therefore, weakness in one particular currency might be offset by strengths in other currencies over time. The extent to which one currency is effective as a natural offset of another currency fluctuates over time. In addition, some foreign currency exposures have little to no mitigating natural offsets available. 68Table of ContentsWe consider our investments in our foreign operations to be denominated in relatively stable currencies and of a long-term nature. As of December\\xa031, 2019, we maintained foreign currency forward contracts and designated them as hedges of a portion of our net investment in TUI Cruises of €173.0 million, or approximately $194.2 million based on the exchange rate at December\\xa031, 2019. These forward currency contracts mature in October 2021.We also address the exposure of our investments in foreign operations by denominating a portion of our debt in our subsidiaries\\' and investments\\' functional currencies and designating it as a hedge of these subsidiaries and investments. We had designated debt as a hedge of our net investments primarily in TUI Cruises of approximately €319.0 million, or approximately $358.1 million, through December\\xa031, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, we had designated debt as a hedge of our net investments primarily in TUI Cruises of approximately €280.0 million, or approximately $320.2 million.We have included net gains of approximately $96.8 million and $86.1 million of foreign-currency transaction remeasurement and changes in the fair value of derivatives in the foreign currency translation adjustment component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, respectively.On a regular basis, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and, from time to time, we utilize cross-currency swap agreements and collar options to minimize the volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than our functional currency or the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries. During 2019, we maintained an average of approximately $689.7 million of these foreign currency forward contracts. These instruments are not designated as hedging instruments. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 changes in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts resulted in gains (losses) of approximately $1.4 million, $(62.4) million and $62.0 million, respectively, which offset gains (losses) arising from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in those same years of $0.4 million, $57.6 million and $(75.6) million, respectively. These changes were recognized in earnings within Other income (expense) in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).Fuel Price Risk Our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates primarily to the consumption of fuel on our ships. Fuel cost (net of the financial impact of fuel swap agreements), as a percentage of our total revenues, was approximately 6.4% in 2019, 7.5% in 2018 and 7.8% in 2017. We use fuel swap agreements to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices.  As of December\\xa031, 2019, we had fuel swap agreements to pay fixed prices for fuel with an aggregate notional amount of approximately $810.0 million, maturing through 2023. The fuel swap agreements represented 54% of our projected 2020 fuel requirements, 30% of our projected 2021 fuel requirements, 19% of our projected 2022 fuel requirements and 5% of our projected 2023 fuel requirements. These fuel swap agreements are generally accounted for as cash flow hedges. The estimated fair value of these contracts at December\\xa031, 2019 was estimated to be a liability of $23.8 million. We estimate that a hypothetical 10% increase in our weighted-average fuel price from that experienced during the year ended December\\xa031, 2019 would increase our forecasted 2020 fuel cost by approximately $36.8 million, net of the impact of fuel swap agreements.Item\\xa08.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Financial Statements and Supplementary DataOur Consolidated Financial Statements and Quarterly Selected Financial Data are included beginning on page\\xa0F-1 of this report.Item\\xa09.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Changes In and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial DisclosureNone.69Table of ContentsItem\\xa09A.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Controls and ProceduresEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresOur management, with the participation of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule\\xa013a-15(e), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon such evaluation, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that those controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission\\'s (the \"SEC\") rules\\xa0and forms.Management\\'s Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule\\xa013a-15(f). Our management, with the participation of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December\\xa031, 2019. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December\\xa031, 2019 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers\\xa0LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form\\xa010-K, as stated in its report, which is included herein on page\\xa0F-2.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Exchange Act Rule\\xa013a-15(d) during the quarter ended December\\xa031, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of ControlsIt should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there is only reasonable assurance that our controls will succeed in achieving their goals under all potential future conditions.Item\\xa09B.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Other InformationNone.70Table of ContentsPART IIIItems\\xa010, 11, 12, 13 and 14.

Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.F-2Table of ContentsBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Ship AccountingAs described in Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had vessels with a net book value of approximately $22.7 billion recorded in its financial statements as of December 31, 2019, with capitalized ship improvement costs of approximately $538 million for the year then ended. Ship improvement costs that add value are capitalized, the useful life of the improvement is estimated, and the replaced asset is disposed of on a net cost basis. Any such improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the improvement’s estimated useful lives or that of the associated ship. Accounting estimates related to ship accounting and determinations of ship improvements costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain. Vessels are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization and depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the vessels. Management considers the costs and estimates of the useful lives of the ships’ component assets, which are categorized into major component systems, such as the hull, superstructure, main electric, engines and cabins, to determine the estimated weighted-average useful life of a vessel. An assessment of cost allocation methodology is performed at the component level, in order to support the estimated weighted-average useful life and residual values, as well as determine the net cost basis of assets being replaced. Management reviews estimated useful lives and residual values periodically for ongoing reasonableness, and where a trigger for change is identified, a review of the estimate is completed. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company invested approximately $170 million of upgrades to its Oasis of the Seas ship under their ship upgrade program. Based on the expected impact of these enhancements, as well as planned future investments and upgrades in the balance of the Oasis class of ships, management now estimates that certain ship components and the overall life of the Oasis class of ships will be extended longer than those previously estimated. In determining the change in estimated useful life and residual value, management utilized quantitative and qualitative analysis, including historical and projected usage patterns, industry benchmarks, planned maintenance programs and projected operational and financial performance of the class. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to ship accounting is a critical audit matter are the significant judgments by management when determining (i) whether ship improvement costs add value to the Company’s ships and are capitalizable; (ii) the related useful life assigned to these ship improvement costs; (iii) the estimated net cost basis of the associated assets being replaced; and (iv) whether changes to estimated weighted-average useful lives and residual values are necessary. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to capitalized ship improvement costs; the estimated useful lives of ship improvement costs; the estimated net cost basis of assets replaced; and management\\'s assessment of the weight-average useful lives and residual values for the Oasis-class ships. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of management’s controls relating to ship improvement costs, including the assessment of the capitalization of ship improvement costs, the estimated useful lives and net cost basis of the assets being replaced and management’s reassessment of the estimated useful lives and residual values for the Oasis class ships during 2019.  These procedures also included, among others, for a sample of ship improvement costs, (i) evaluating whether the costs capitalized add value to a ship; (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of the assigned estimated useful lives; and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of the estimated net cost basis of the assets being replaced.  Further, for management’s reassessment of estimated useful life and residual value of the Oasis class of ships, our procedures included (i) evaluating the reasonableness of the 35 year useful life and 10% residual value assigned to the Oasis class ships, considering management’s historical experience with similarly built ships, as well as consideration of anticipated technology and market changes (ii) evaluating the reasonableness of the changes in the estimated useful lives and residual values at the component asset level, (iii) evaluating the feasibility of management’s intended use of the Oasis class of ships, considering 1) historical and projected use patterns 2) consistency of planned refurbishments and maintenance with current program 3) consistency of projected forecasts with past performance and 4) consistency with industry external data. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of the assets being replaced and the estimated useful life and residual value of the Oasis class of ships.

statements.F-9Table of ContentsROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES\\xa0LTD.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNote\\xa01. GeneralDescription of BusinessWe are a global cruise company. We own and operate four global cruise brands: Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, Azamara and Silversea Cruises (collectively, our \"Global Brands\"). We also own a 50% joint venture interest in the German brand TUI Cruises and a 49% interest in the Spanish brand Pullmantur (collectively, our \"Partner Brands\"). We account for our investments in our Partner Brands under the equity method of accounting. Together, our Global Brands and our Partner Brands operate a combined 61 ships as of December\\xa031, 2019. Our ships operate on a selection of worldwide itineraries that call on more than 1,000 destinations on all seven continents.On July 31, 2018, we acquired a 66.7% equity stake in Silversea Cruise Holding Ltd. (\"Silversea Cruises\"), an ultra-luxury and expedition cruise line with nine ships, from Silversea Cruises Group Ltd. (\"SCG\") for $1.02 billion in cash and contingent consideration. Refer to Note 3. Business Combination for further information on the Silversea Cruises acquisition.Basis for Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). Estimates are required for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with these principles. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Refer to Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for a discussion of our significant accounting policies.All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. We consolidate entities over which we have control, usually evidenced by a direct ownership interest of greater than 50%, and variable interest entities where we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. Refer to Note\\xa08. Other Assets for further information regarding our variable interest entities. We consolidate the operating results of Silversea Cruises on a three-month reporting lag to allow for more timely preparation of our consolidated financial statements. No material events or other transactions involving Silversea Cruises have occurred from September\\xa030, 2019 through December\\xa031, 2019 that would require further disclosure or adjustment to our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December\\xa031, 2019. For affiliates we do not control but over which we have significant influence on financial and operating policies, usually evidenced by a direct ownership interest from 20% to 50%, the investment is accounted for using the equity method. Note\\xa02. Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesRevenues and ExpensesDeposits received on sales of passenger cruises are initially recorded as customer deposit liabilities on our balance sheet. Customer deposits are subsequently recognized as passenger ticket revenues, together with revenues from onboard and other goods and services and all associated cruise operating expenses of a voyage. For further information on revenue recognition, refer to Note. 4 Revenues. Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents include cash and marketable securities with original maturities of less than 90\\xa0days.InventoriesInventories consist of provisions, supplies and fuel carried at the lower of cost (weighted-average) or net realizable value.The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.F-10Table of ContentsROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We capitalize interest as part of the cost of acquiring certain assets. Improvement costs that we believe add value to our ships are capitalized as additions to the ship, the useful lives of the improvements are estimated and depreciated over the shorter of the improvements\\' estimated useful lives or that of the associated ship, and the replaced assets are disposed of on a net cost basis. The estimated cost and accumulated depreciation of replaced or refurbished ship components are written off and any resulting losses are recognized in Cruise operating expenses. Liquidated damages received from shipyards as a result of the late delivery of a new ship are recorded as reductions to the cost basis of the ship. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. The useful lives of our ships are generally 30-35 years, net of a 10%-15% projected residual value. The 30-35-year useful life and 10%-15% residual value are based on the weighted-average of all major components of a ship. Our useful life and residual value estimates take into consideration the impact of anticipated technological changes, long-term cruise and vacation market conditions and historical useful lives of similarly-built ships. In addition, we take into consideration our estimates of the weighted-average useful lives of the ships\\' major component systems, such as hull, superstructure, main electric, engines and cabins. We employ a cost allocation methodology at the component level, in order to support the estimated weighted-average useful lives and residual values, as well as to determine the net cost basis of assets being replaced. Given the very large and complex nature of our ships, our accounting estimates related to ships and determinations of ship improvement costs to be capitalized require considerable judgment and are inherently uncertain. Depreciation for assets under capital leases is computed using the shorter of the lease term or related asset life. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed utilizing the following useful lives:YearsShipsgenerally, 30-35Ship improvements3-25Buildings and improvements10-40Computer hardware and software3-10Transportation equipment and other3-30Leasehold improvementsShorter of remaining lease term or useful life 3-30We periodically review estimated useful lives and residual values for ongoing reasonableness, considering long term views on our intended use of each class of ships and the planned level of improvements to maintain and enhance vessels within those classes. In the event a factor is identified that may trigger a change in the estimated useful lives and residual values of our ships, a review of the estimate is completed. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we completed a modernization of the Oasis of the Seas under our ship upgrade program. We spent $538.0\\xa0million under this ship upgrade program for the year ended December 31, 2019, with the Oasis of the Seas representing approximately $170.0\\xa0million. As a result of this capital investment and future planned investments in our Oasis-class ships, we performed a review of the estimated useful lives and residual values of Oasis-class ships, concluding in a change to the estimate. Effective fourth quarter of 2019, we revised the estimated useful lives of our Oasis-class ships from 30 years with a 15%  residual value to 35 years with a 10% residual value. The change in the estimated useful lives and residual values was accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimate. The 35-year useful life with a 10% residual value is based on revised estimates of the weighted-average useful life of all major ship components for the Oasis-class ships. The change in estimate is consistent with our recent investments in and future plans to continue to invest in the upgrade of these ships, resulting in the use of certain ship components longer than originally estimated.  In determining the change in estimated useful life and residual value, we utilized quantitative and qualitative analysis, including historical and projected usage patterns, industry benchmarks, planned maintenance programs and projected operational and financial performance of the class. The change allows us to better match depreciation expense with the periods these assets are expected to be in use. For the year ended F-11Table of ContentsROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)December 31, 2019, this change increased operating income and net income by approximately $4.6\\xa0million and increased earnings per share by $0.02 per share on a basic and diluted basis.We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate, based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows, that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable. For purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The lowest level for which we maintain identifiable cash flows that are independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities is at the ship level for our ships. If estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset, an impairment charge is recognized to the extent its carrying value exceeds fair value.We use the deferral method to account for drydocking costs. Under the deferral method, drydocking costs incurred are deferred and charged to expense on a straight-line basis over the period to the next scheduled drydock, which we estimate to be a period of thirty to sixty months based on the vessel\\'s age as required by Class. Deferred drydock costs consist of the costs to drydock the vessel and other costs incurred in connection with the drydock which are necessary to maintain the vessel\\'s Class certification. Class certification is necessary in order for our cruise ships to be flagged in a specific country, obtain liability insurance and legally operate as passenger cruise ships. The activities associated with those drydocking costs cannot be performed while the vessel is in service and, as such, are done during a drydock as a planned major maintenance activity. The significant deferred drydock costs consist of hauling and wharfage services provided by the drydock facility, hull inspection and related activities (e.g., scraping, pressure cleaning, bottom painting), maintenance to steering propulsion, thruster equipment and ballast tanks, port services such as tugs, pilotage and line handling, and freight associated with these items. We perform a detailed analysis of the various activities performed for each drydock and only defer those costs that are directly related to planned major maintenance activities necessary to maintain Class. The costs deferred are not otherwise routinely periodically performed to maintain a vessel\\'s designed and intended operating capability. Repairs and maintenance activities are charged to expense as incurred.GoodwillGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. We review goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or, when events or circumstances dictate, more frequently. The impairment review for goodwill consists of a qualitative assessment of whether it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit\\'s fair value is less than its carrying amount, and if necessary, a two-step goodwill impairment test. Factors to consider when performing the qualitative assessment include general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, changes in forecasted operating results, changes in fuel prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. If the qualitative assessment demonstrates that it is more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, it is not necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. We may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to step one, for any reporting unit, in any period. On a periodic basis, we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed to step one to corroborate the results of recent years\\' qualitative assessments. We can resume the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any subsequent period. When performing the two-step goodwill impairment test, the fair value of the reporting unit is determined and compared to the carrying value of the net assets allocated to the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no further analysis or write-down of goodwill is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its net assets, the implied fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all its underlying assets and liabilities, including both recognized and unrecognized tangible and intangible assets, based on their fair value. If necessary, goodwill is then written down to its implied fair value.Intangible AssetsIn connection with our acquisitions, we have acquired certain intangible assets to which value has been assigned  based on our estimates. Intangible assets that are deemed to have an indefinite life are not amortized, but are subject to an annual impairment test, or when events or circumstances dictate, more frequently. The impairment review for indefinite-life intangible assets can be performed using a qualitative or quantitative impairment assessment. The quantitative assessment consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-life intangible F-12Table of ContentsROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. If the fair value exceeds its carrying amount, the indefinite-life intangible asset is not considered impaired. Other intangible assets assigned finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.Contingencies\\xa0— LitigationOn an ongoing basis, we assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us. While it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of such actions, we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to the settlement or final adjudication of such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss, if any, can be made. In assessing probable losses, we take into consideration estimates of the amount of insurance recoveries, if any, which are recorded as assets when recoverability is probable. We accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to the inherent uncertainties related to the eventual outcome of litigation and potential insurance recoveries, it is possible that certain matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any provisions or disclosures that we have previously made.Advertising CostsAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred except those costs which result in tangible assets, such as brochures, which are treated as prepaid expenses and charged to expense as consumed. Advertising costs consist of media advertising as well as brochure, production and direct mail costs. Media advertising was $309.4 million, $255.7 million and $233.5 million, and brochure, production and direct mail costs were $156.0 million, $133.4 million and $126.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Derivative InstrumentsWe enter into various forward, swap and option contracts to manage our interest rate exposure and to limit our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. These instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and the vast majority are designated as hedges. We also use non-derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of our net investment in our foreign operations and investments. Although certain of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify or are not accounted for under hedge accounting, our objective is not to hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes.At inception of the hedge relationship, a derivative instrument that hedges the exposure to changes in the fair value of a firm commitment or a recognized asset or liability is designated as a fair value hedge. A derivative instrument that hedges a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows related to a recognized asset or liability is designated as a cash flow hedge.Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges are offset against changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments. Gains and losses on derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss until the underlying hedged transactions are recognized in earnings. The foreign currency transaction gain or loss of our non-derivative financial instruments and the changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges of our net investment in foreign operations and investments are recognized as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss along with the associated foreign currency translation adjustment of the foreign operation or investment. In certain hedges of our net investment in foreign operations and investments, we exclude forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and we amortize the related amounts directly into earnings.On an ongoing basis, we assess whether derivatives used in hedging transactions are \"highly effective\" in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flow of hedged items. For our net investment hedges, we use the dollar offset method to measure effectiveness. For all other hedging programs, we use the long-haul method to assess hedge effectiveness using regression analysis for each hedge relationship. The methodology for assessing hedge F-13Table of ContentsROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)effectiveness is applied on a consistent basis for each one of our hedging programs (i.e., interest rate, foreign currency ship construction, foreign currency net investment and fuel). For our regression analyses, we use an observation period of up to three years, utilizing market data relevant to the hedge horizon of each hedge relationship. High effectiveness is achieved when a statistically valid relationship reflects a high degree of offset and correlation between the changes in the fair values of the derivative instrument and the hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or hedge accounting is discontinued, any change in fair value of the derivative since the last date at which it was determined to be effective is recognized in earnings. Cash flows from derivative instruments that are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the underlying hedged items. In the event that hedge accounting is discontinued, cash flows subsequent to the date of discontinuance are classified within investing activities. Cash flows from derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are classified as investing activities.We consider the classification of the underlying hedged item’s cash flows in determining the classification for the designated derivative instrument’s cash flows. We classify derivative instrument cash flows from hedges of benchmark interest rate or hedges of fuel expense as operating activities due to the nature of the hedged item. Likewise, we classify derivative instrument cash flows from hedges of foreign currency risk on our newbuild ship payments as investing activities. Foreign Currency Translations and TransactionsWe translate assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency, at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. We translate revenues and expenses at weighted-average exchange rates for the period. Equity is translated at historical rates and the resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are included as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is reflected as a separate component of Shareholders\\' equity. Exchange gains or losses arising from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are immediately included in our earnings, except for certain liabilities that have been designated to act as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation or investment. Exchange gains (losses) were $0.4 million, $57.6 million and $(75.6) million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and were recorded within Other income (expense). The majority of our transactions are settled in United States dollars. Gains or losses resulting from transactions denominated in other currencies are recognized in income at each balance sheet date.Concentrations of Credit RiskWe monitor our credit risk associated with financial and other institutions with which we conduct significant business and, to minimize these risks, we select counterparties with credit risks acceptable to us and we seek to limit our exposure to an individual counterparty. Credit risk, including but not limited to counterparty nonperformance under derivative instruments, our credit facilities and new ship progress payment guarantees, is not considered significant, as we primarily conduct business with large, well-established financial institutions, insurance companies and export credit agencies many of which we have long-term relationships with and which have credit risks acceptable to us or where the credit risk is spread out among a large number of counterparties. As of December\\xa031, 2019, we had no counterparty credit risk exposure under our derivative instruments compared to credit risk exposures of $5.6 million on December 31, 2018, which were limited to the cost of replacing the contracts in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to the contracts, the majority of which are currently our lending banks. We do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our significant counterparties. In addition, we have established guidelines we follow regarding credit ratings and instrument maturities to maintain safety and liquidity. We do not normally require collateral or other security to support credit relationships; however, in certain circumstances this option is available to us.Earnings Per ShareBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing Net Income attributable to Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share incorporates the incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options and conversion of potentially dilutive securities. F-14Table of ContentsROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)Stock-Based Employee CompensationWe measure and recognize compensation expense at the estimated fair value of employee stock awards. Compensation expense for awards and the related tax effects are recognized as they vest. We use the estimated amount of expected forfeitures to calculate compensation costs for all outstanding awards.Segment ReportingWe control and operate four global cruise brands: Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, Azamara and Silversea Cruises. We also own a 50% joint venture interest in the German brand TUI Cruises, a 49% interest in the Spanish brand Pullmantur. We believe our brands possess the versatility to enter multiple cruise market segments within the cruise vacation industry. Although each of these brands has its own marketing style as well as ships and crews of various sizes, the nature of the products sold and services delivered by these brands share a common base (i.e.,\\xa0the sale and provision of cruise vacations). Our brands also have similar itineraries as well as similar cost and revenue components. In addition, our brands source passengers from similar markets around the world and operate in similar economic environments with a significant degree of commercial overlap. As a result, our brands have been aggregated as a single reportable segment based on the similarity of their economic characteristics, types of consumers, regulatory environment, maintenance requirements, supporting systems and processes as well as products and services provided. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the chief operating decision-maker and all significant operating decisions including the allocation of resources are based upon the analyses of the Company as one segment. Refer to Note 4. Revenues for passenger ticket revenue information by geographic area.Adoption of Accounting PronouncementsLeasesOn January 1, 2019, we adopted the guidance codified in Accounting Standard Codification (\"ASC\") 842, Leases (\"ASC 842\") using the modified retrospective approach and elected the optional transition method, which allows entities to initially apply the standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. Upon adoption, we applied the guidance to all existing leases.For leases with a term greater than 12 months, the new guidance requires the lease rights and obligations arising from the leasing arrangements, including operating leases, to be recognized as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. Upon adoption of the new guidance, the most significant impact was the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities relating to operating leases in the amounts of $801.8\\xa0million and $820.5\\xa0million, respectively, reported within Operating lease right-of-use assets and Long-term operating lease liabilities, respectively, with the current portion of the liability reported within Current portion of operating lease liabilities, in our consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019. Accounting for finance leases remained substantially unchanged and continues to be reported within Property and equipment, net and Long-term debt, with the current portion of the debt reported within Current portion of debt, in our consolidated balance sheets. There was no cumulative effect of applying the new standard and accordingly there was no adjustment to our retained earnings upon adoption. The comparative information presented has not been recast and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. For further information on leases, refer to Note 10. Leases.This guidance did not have a material impact to our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), consolidated statements of cash flows and our debt-covenants calculations under our current agreements.Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standard Update (\"ASU\") 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326); Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU, along with subsequent ASUs issued to clarify certain of its provisions, introduces new guidance which makes substantive changes to the accounting model for financial assets subject to credit losses that are measured at amortized cost, as well as certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. The primary updates include the introduction of a new current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model that is based on expected rather than F-15Table of ContentsROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)incurred losses. This ASU and the related amendments will be effective for our annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2020. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have to our consolidated financial statements.In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) – Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating the second step of the goodwill impairment test. Under the new standard, goodwill impairment should be recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, but should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. This ASU will be effective for our annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2020. This guidance is not expected to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements, but may require us to modify our annual or interim goodwill impairment tests.In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Topic 350-40), which requires a customer in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract to follow the internal-use software guidance to determine which implementation costs to capitalize as assets or expense as incurred. This ASU will be effective for our annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2020 and we expect to elect the prospective adoption method. The guidance may impact the accounting treatment of our future implementation costs related to cloud computing arrangements.In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-01, Investments – Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivative and Hedging (Topic 815), which clarifies the interaction of rules for equity securities, the equity method of accounting, and forward contracts and purchase options on certain types of securities. The guidance clarifies how to account for the transition into and out of the equity method of accounting when considering observable transactions under the measurement alternative. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim reporting periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements.ReclassificationsFor the year ended December\\xa031, 2019, we separately presented Amortization of commercial paper notes discount in our consolidated statements of cash flows. As a result, the prior year amortization amount was reclassified within Operating Activities to conform to the current year presentation.Note 3. Business CombinationOn July 31, 2018, we acquired a 66.7% equity stake in Silversea Cruise Holding Ltd. (\"Silversea Cruises\"),  an ultra-luxury and expedition cruise line, from Heritage Cruise Holding Ltd. (\"HCH\"), previously known as Silversea Cruises Group Ltd. Silversea Cruises enhances our presence in the ultra-luxury and expedition markets and provides us with an opportunity to drive long-term capacity growth in these markets.The purchase price consisted of $1.02 billion in cash, net of assumed liabilities, and contingent consideration that can range from zero up to a maximum of approximately 472,000 shares of our common stock, and is payable upon achievement of certain 2019-2020 performance metrics by Silversea Cruises. The fair value of the contingent consideration at the acquisition date was $44.0 million. Changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recorded in our results of operations, if any, in the period of the change. Refer to Note 18. Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments for further information on the valuation of the contingent consideration.To finance a portion of the purchase price, we drew in full on a $700 million unsecured credit agreement and the remainder of the transaction consideration was financed through the use of our revolving credit facilities. Refer to Note 9. Debt for further information on the credit agreement. We have accounted for this transaction under the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations. The purchase price for the\\xa0Silversea Cruises acquisition\\xa0was allocated based on estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, with the excess allocated to goodwill. Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes and consisted primarily of the opportunity to expand our cruise operations in strategic growth areas.F-16Table of ContentsROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)For reporting purposes, we included Silversea Cruises’ results of operations on a three-month reporting lag from October 1, 2018 through September\\xa030, 2019 in our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 and from the July 31, 2018 date of acquisition through September 30, 2018 in our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018. We have included Silversea Cruises\\' balance sheets as of September\\xa030, 2019 and 2018 in our consolidated balance sheets as of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Refer to Note 1.

Additionally, the deferred tax liability recognized in connection with the acquisition of Silversea Cruises was not material to our consolidated financial statements and there were no net operating losses recognized as of December\\xa031, 2018.For the year ended December\\xa031, 2018, Total revenues and Net Income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) include $130.1\\xa0million and $3.3\\xa0million, respectively, of revenues and net income from Silversea Cruises since the date of acquisition through September 30, 2018. For the year ended December\\xa031, 2018, our results of operations also include transaction-related costs of $31.8\\xa0million, which were included primarily within Marketing, selling and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).Pro-forma financial results relating to the Silversea Cruises acquisition are not presented, as this acquisition was not material to our consolidated results of operations. Note 4. RevenuesRevenue RecognitionRevenues are measured based on consideration specified in our contracts with customers and are recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied.The majority of our revenues are derived from passenger cruise contracts which are reported within Passenger ticket revenues in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Our performance obligation under these contracts is to provide a cruise vacation in exchange for the ticket price. We satisfy this performance obligation and recognize revenue over the duration of each cruise, which generally range from two to 25 nights.Passenger ticket revenues include charges to our guests for port costs that vary with passenger head counts. These type of port costs, along with port costs that do not vary by passenger head counts, are included in our operating expenses. The amounts of port costs charged to our guests and included within Passenger ticket revenues on a gross basis were $666.8\\xa0million, $611.4\\xa0million and $569.5\\xa0million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Our total revenues also include onboard and other revenues, which consist primarily of revenues from the sale of goods and services onboard our ships that are not included in passenger ticket prices. We receive payment before or concurrently with the transfer of these goods and services to passengers during a cruise and recognize revenue at the time of transfer over the duration of the related cruise.As a practical expedient, we have omitted disclosures on our remaining performance obligations as the duration of our contracts with customers is less than a year.F-18Table of ContentsROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)Disaggregated RevenuesThe following table disaggregates our total revenues by geographic regions where we provide cruise itineraries (in thousands): Year Ended December 31,201920182017Revenues by itineraryNorth America(1)$6,392,354\\xa0\\xa0$5,399,951\\xa0\\xa0$5,062,305\\xa0\\xa0Asia/Pacific(2)1,529,898\\xa0\\xa01,463,083\\xa0\\xa01,588,802\\xa0\\xa0Europe(3)1,942,057\\xa0\\xa01,914,549\\xa0\\xa01,509,586\\xa0\\xa0Other regions567,904\\xa0\\xa0348,145\\xa0\\xa0285,954\\xa0\\xa0Total revenues by itinerary10,432,213\\xa0\\xa09,125,728\\xa0\\xa08,446,647\\xa0\\xa0Other revenues(4)518,448\\xa0\\xa0368,121\\xa0\\xa0331,198\\xa0\\xa0Total revenues$10,950,661\\xa0\\xa0$9,493,849\\xa0\\xa0$8,777,845\\xa0\\xa0(1)Includes the United States, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean.(2)Includes Southeast Asia (e.g., Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines), East Asia (e.g., China and Japan), South Asia (e.g., India and Pakistan) and Oceania (e.g., Australia and Fiji Islands) regions.(3)Includes European countries (e.g., the Nordics, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom).

Amounts also include revenues related to our bareboat charter, procurement and management related services we perform on behalf of our unconsolidated affiliates. Refer to Note 8. Other Assets for more information on our unconsolidated affiliates.Passenger ticket revenues are attributed to geographic areas based on where the reservation originates. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our guests were sourced from the following areas:Year Ended December 31,201920182017Passenger ticket revenues:United States65\\xa0%61\\xa0%59\\xa0%United Kingdom9\\xa0%10\\xa0%9\\xa0%All other countries (1)26\\xa0%29\\xa0%32\\xa0%(1)No other individual country\\'s revenue exceeded 10% for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.Customer Deposits and Contract LiabilitiesOur payment terms generally require an upfront deposit to confirm a reservation, with the balance due prior to the cruise. Deposits received on sales of passenger cruises are initially recorded as Customer deposits in our consolidated balance sheets and subsequently recognized as passenger ticket revenues during the duration of the cruise. ASC 606, Revenues from Contracts with Customers, defines a “contract liability” as an entity’s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the entity has received consideration from the customer. We consider customer deposits to be a contract liability once the customer no longer retains the unilateral right, resulting from the passage of time, to cancel such customer\\'s reservation and receive a full refund. Customer deposits as of December\\xa031, 2019, 2018 and 2017 included contract liabilities of $1.7\\xa0billion, $1.9 billion and $1.4\\xa0billion, respectively. Substantially all of our contract liabilities as of the years ended December\\xa031, 2018 and 2017 were recognized and reported within Total revenues in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.Contract Receivables and Contract AssetsAlthough we generally require full payment from our customers prior to their cruise, we grant credit terms to a relatively small portion of our revenue sourced in select markets outside of the United States. As a result, we have F-19Table of ContentsROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)outstanding receivables from passenger cruise contracts in those markets. We also have receivables from credit card merchants for cruise ticket purchases and goods and services sold to guests during cruises that are collected before, during or shortly after the cruise voyage. In addition, we have receivables due from concessionaires onboard our vessels. These receivables are included within Trade and other receivables, net in our consolidated balance sheets. We have contract assets that are conditional rights to consideration for satisfying the construction services performance obligations under a service concession arrangement. As of December\\xa031, 2019, 2018, and 2017, our contract assets were $55.5\\xa0million, $57.8 million and $60.1\\xa0million, respectively, and were included within Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Given the short duration of our cruises and our collection terms, we do not have any other significant contract assets.Assets Recognized from the Costs to Obtain a Contract with a CustomerPrepaid travel agent commissions are an incremental cost of obtaining contracts with customers that we recognize as an asset and include within Prepaid expenses and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Prepaid travel agent commissions were $163.2\\xa0million and $153.5 million as of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Substantially all of our prepaid travel agent commissions at December\\xa031, 2018 and December 31, 2017 were expensed and reported within Commissions, transportation and other in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.Note\\xa05.

Refer to Note 3. Business Combination for further information. (2)In 2019, we purchased the photo operations onboard our ships from our previous concessionaire. The acquisition was accounted for as a business purchase combination using the purchase method of accounting which requires the use of fair value measurements. The business combination, including purchase transaction and assets acquired, was immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we performed a qualitative assessment of whether it was more-likely-than-not that our Royal Caribbean International reporting unit\\'s fair value was less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill impairment test. The qualitative analysis included assessing the impact of certain factors such as general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, changes in forecasted operating results, changes in fuel prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Based on our qualitative assessment, we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of the Royal Caribbean International reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and thus, we did not proceed to the two-step goodwill impairment test. No indicators of impairment exist primarily because the reporting unit\\'s fair value has consistently exceeded its carrying value by a significant margin and forecasts of operating results generated by the reporting unit appear sufficient to F-20Table of ContentsROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)support its carrying value. As a result of our assessment, we did not record an impairment of goodwill for the year ended December\\xa031, 2019.During the fourth quarter of 2019, we also performed a qualitative assessment of whether it was more-likely-than-not that our Silversea Cruises reporting unit\\'s fair value was less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill impairment test.

During 2018, we completed our purchase of Azamara Pursuit and took delivery of Symphony of the Seas and Celebrity Edge. Refer to Note 9. Debt for further information.F-22Table of ContentsROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)Upon our acquisition of Silversea Cruises, we added nine ships to our fleet, two of which are under capital lease agreements and one under an operating lease. As of December 31, 2019, Silversea Cruises operates eight ships as the operating lease for Silver Discover was terminated during 2019. Refer to Note 3. Business Combination for further information on the Silversea Cruises acquisition and Note 9. Debt for further information on the capital leases.During 2017, we sold our three aircraft and 6% of our ownership stake in Wamos Air, S.A. (formerly known as Pullmantur Air, S.A.) to Wamos Air, S.A. In connection with the sale transaction, we extended two loans to Wamos Air, S.A. totaling €17.3 million. During the year ended December\\xa031, 2019, we received principal and interest payments of €5.4 million resulting in full repayment of one of the loans. As of December\\xa031, 2019, a receivable of €9.9 million, or approximately $11.1 million, based on the exchange rate at December\\xa031, 2019, was outstanding related to the principal amount of the remaining loan. The remaining loan accrues interest at 5.25% per annum, amortizes through maturity of July 2021, and is secured by first priority security interests over the aircraft engines and shares sold in connection with the transaction. The sale resulted in an immaterial gain that was recognized in earnings during the year ended December\\xa031, 2017. Post-sale, we retained a 13% interest in Wamos Air, S.A. During 2017, we sold Legend of the Seas to an affiliate of TUI AG, our joint venture partner in TUI Cruises. The sale resulted in a gain of $30.9 million and was reported within Other operating within Cruise operating expenses in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December\\xa031, 2017.In January of 2020, Zenith was sold to a third party for approximately its net book value. Zenith was previously bareboat chartered to Pullmantur Holdings S.L.Note\\xa08. Other AssetsA Variable Interest Entity (\"VIE\") is an entity in which the equity investors have not provided enough equity to finance the entity\\'s activities or the equity investors (1)\\xa0cannot directly or indirectly make decisions about the entity\\'s activities through their voting rights or similar rights; (2)\\xa0do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity; (3)\\xa0do not have the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; or (4)\\xa0have voting rights that are not proportionate to their economic interests and the entity\\'s activities involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor with a disproportionately small voting interest.We have determined that TUI Cruises GmbH, our 50%-owned joint venture, which operates the brand TUI Cruises, is a VIE. As of December\\xa031, 2019, the net book value of our investment in TUI Cruises was $598.1\\xa0million, primarily consisting of $443.1 million in equity and a loan of €133.2 million, or approximately $149.5 million, based on the exchange rate at December\\xa031, 2019. As of December\\xa031, 2018, the net book value of our investment in TUI Cruises was $578.1 million, primarily consisting of $403.0 million in equity and a loan of €150.6 million, or approximately $172.2 million, based on the exchange rate at December\\xa031, 2018. The loan, which was made in connection with the sale of Splendour of the Seas in April 2016, accrues interest at a rate of 6.25% per annum and is payable over 10 years. This loan is 50% guaranteed by TUI AG, our joint venture partner in TUI Cruises, and is secured by a first priority mortgage on the ship. Refer to Note 7. Property and Equipment for further information. The majority of these amounts were included within Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets.In addition, we and TUI AG have each guaranteed the repayment by TUI Cruises of 50% of a bank loan. As of December\\xa031, 2019, the outstanding principal amount of the loan was €26.4 million, or approximately $29.7 million, based on the exchange rate at December\\xa031, 2019. The loan amortizes quarterly and is currently secured by a first mortgage on Mein Schiff Herz. Based on current facts and circumstances, we do not believe potential obligations under our guarantee of this bank loan are probable. In addition to our guarantee of the bank loan, TUI Cruises has various ship construction and financing agreements which include certain restrictions on each of our and TUI AG’s ability to reduce our current ownership interest in TUI Cruises below 37.55% through May 2031.Our investment amount, outstanding term loan and the potential obligations under the bank loan guarantee are substantially our maximum exposure to loss in connection with our investment in TUI Cruises.\\xa0We have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of TUI Cruises.\\xa0We believe that the power to direct the activities that most F-23Table of ContentsROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)significantly impact TUI Cruises’ economic performance are shared between ourselves and TUI AG.\\xa0All the significant operating and financial decisions of TUI Cruises require the consent of both parties, which we believe creates shared power over TUI Cruises.\\xa0Accordingly, we do not consolidate this entity and account for this investment under the equity method of accounting.In March 2009, we sold Celebrity Galaxy to TUI Cruises for €224.4 million, or $290.9 million, to serve as the original Mein Schiff 1. Due to the related party nature of this transaction, the gain on the sale of the ship of $35.9 million was deferred and being recognized over the remaining life of the ship which was estimated to be 23 years. In April 2018, TUI Cruises sold the original Mein Schiff 1 and as a result we accelerated the recognition of the remaining balance of the deferred gain, which was $21.8 million. This amount is included within Other income (expense) in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December\\xa031, 2018.On February 7, 2020, TUI Cruises entered into an agreement to acquire Hapag-Lloyd Cruises, a luxury and expedition brand for German-speaking guests, from TUI AG. Hapag-Lloyd Cruises operates two luxury liners and three smaller expedition ships. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. We have determined that Pullmantur Holdings S.L. (\"Pullmantur Holdings\"), which operates the Pullmantur brand and in which we have a 49% noncontrolling interest and Springwater Capital LLC has a 51% interest, is a VIE for which we are not the primary beneficiary, as we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity\\'s economic performance. Accordingly, we do not consolidate this entity and we account for this investment under the equity method of accounting. As of December\\xa031, 2019 and December\\xa031, 2018, our maximum exposure to loss in Pullmantur Holdings was $49.7\\xa0million and $58.5 million, respectively, consisting of loans and other receivables. These amounts were included within Trade and other receivables, net and Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We have provided a non-revolving working capital facility to a Pullmantur Holdings subsidiary in the amount of up to €15.0 million or approximately $16.8 million based on the exchange rate at December\\xa031, 2019. Proceeds of the facility, which were available to be drawn through December 31, 2018 accrue interest at an interest rate of 6.5% per annum, are payable through 2022. An affiliate of Springwater Capital LLC, has guaranteed repayment of 51% of the outstanding amounts under the facility. As of December\\xa031, 2019, €11.0 million, or approximately $12.3 million, based on the exchange rate at December\\xa031, 2019, was outstanding under this facility. As of December\\xa031, 2018, €14.0\\xa0million, or approximately $16.0\\xa0million, based on the exchange rate at December\\xa031, 2018, was outstanding under this facility. We have determined that Grand Bahama Shipyard\\xa0Ltd. (\"Grand Bahama\"), a ship repair and maintenance facility in which we have a 40% noncontrolling interest, is a VIE. This facility serves cruise and cargo ships, oil and gas tankers and offshore units. We utilize this facility, among other ship repair facilities, for our regularly scheduled drydocks, ship upgrades and certain emergency repairs as may be required. During the years ended December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, we made payments of $45.7 million and $44.7 million, respectively, to Grand Bahama for ship repair and maintenance services. We have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of this facility, as we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the facility\\'s economic performance. Accordingly, we do not consolidate this entity and we account for this investment under the equity method of accounting. As of December\\xa031, 2019, the net book value of our investment in Grand Bahama was $47.9 million, consisting of $27.0 million in equity and loans of $20.9 million. As of December\\xa031, 2018, the net book value of our investment in Grand Bahama was approximately $56.1 million, consisting of $41.4 million in equity and loans of $14.6\\xa0million. These amounts represent our maximum exposure to loss related to our investment in Grand Bahama. Our loans to Grand Bahama mature between December 2020 and March 2026 and bear interest at  LIBOR plus 2.0% to 3.75%, capped at  5.75% for the majority of the outstanding loan balance. Interest payable on the loans is due on a semi-annual basis. During the years ended December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, we received principal and interest payments of $8.6 million and $16.4 million, respectively. The loan balances are included within Trade and other receivables, net and  Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. The loans are currently accruing interest under the effective yield method. F-24Table of ContentsROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)We monitor credit risk associated with the loan through our participation on Grand Bahama\\'s board of directors along with our review of Grand Bahama\\'s financial statements and projected cash flows. Based on this review, we believe the risk of loss associated with the outstanding loan is not probable as of December\\xa031, 2019.In April 2019, Grand Bahama experienced an incident involving one of its drydocks where Oasis of the Seas was undergoing maintenance.\\xa0 The damage from the incident resulted in a write-off of the related drydock by Grand Bahama.\\xa0 Our equity investment income for the year ended December 31, 2019 reflects our equity share of the write-off and other incidental expenses.\\xa0Grand Bahama\\'s management is working with its insurance underwriter to determine coverage under their existing policies. In March 2018, we and Ctrip.com International Ltd. (\"Ctrip\") announced the decision to end the Skysea Holding International Ltd. (\"Skysea Holding\") venture in which we have a 36% ownership interest. As a result, we reviewed the recoverability of our investment in Skysea Holding and determined that our investment,  debt facility and other receivables due from the brand were impaired and recognized an impairment charge of $23.3 million which was included within Other (expense) income in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December\\xa031, 2018. The charge reflected a full impairment of our investment in SkySea Holding and other receivables due to us and reduced the debt facility and related accrued interest due to us  to Skysea Holdings to its net realizable value. In December 2018, the Golden Era, the ship operated by SkySea Cruises, and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Skysea Holdings, was sold to an affiliate of TUI AG. Proceeds from the sale were distributed to Ctrip and us, which eliminated our net receivable balance due from Skysea Holding, resulting in no further impairment charges. As of December\\xa031, 2019, we do not have any exposures to loss related to our investment in Skysea Holding.

The interest rate and facility fee vary with our senior debt rating and are currently set at LIBOR plus 1.0% per annum and 0.125% per annum, respectively. These amendments did not result in the extinguishment of debt. In addition, in May 2019, we amended our $1.15\\xa0billion unsecured revolving credit facility due in 2022 to reduce pricing to match pricing on our $1.7\\xa0billion unsecured revolving credit facility due in 2024.In April 2019, we entered into and drew in full on an unsecured three-year term loan agreement in the amount of $1.0\\xa0billion. The loan accrues interest at a floating rate of LIBOR plus an applicable margin, which varies with our senior debt rating, and is currently 1.075% per annum. Proceeds of this loan were used to repay the $700\\xa0million 364-day loan due July 2019 related to the acquisition of Silversea Cruises and the remaining balance of the unsecured term loan originally incurred in 2010 to purchase Allure of the Seas. The repayment of these loans resulted in a total loss on the extinguishment of debt of $6.3\\xa0million, which was recognized within Other (expense) income within our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.In April 2019, we took delivery of Spectrum of the Seas. To finance the purchase, we borrowed $908.0\\xa0million under a previously committed unsecured term loan which is 95% guaranteed by Euler Hermes Aktiengesellschaft, the official export credit agency of Germany. The loan amortizes semi-annually over 12 years and bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.45% per annum. F-27Table of ContentsROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)In May 2019, we took delivery of Celebrity Flora. The purchase was financed through an unsecured term loan facility entered into in November 2017 in an amount up to €80.0\\xa0million, or approximately $89.8\\xa0million based on the exchange rate at December\\xa031, 2019. As of December\\xa031, 2019, we had fully drawn on this facility. The loan is due and payable at maturity in November 2024. Interest on the loan accrues at a floating rate based on EURIBOR plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin varies with our debt rating and was 1.195% as of December\\xa031, 2019.In June 2018, we established a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue short-term unsecured notes from time to time in an aggregate amount of up to $1.2 billion, which was increased to $2.9\\xa0billion in August 2019. The commercial paper issued is backstopped by our revolving credit facilities. As of December\\xa031, 2019, we had $1.4 billion of commercial paper notes outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of\\xa02.19% and a weighted average maturity of approximately 21 days. As of December 31, 2018 we had $777.0\\xa0million of commercial paper notes outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 3.19% and a weighted average maturity of approximately 23 days.Except for Celebrity Flora, all of our unsecured ship financing term loans are guaranteed by the export credit agency in the respective country in which the ship is constructed. In consideration for these guarantees, depending on the financing arrangement, we pay to the applicable export credit agency (1) a fee of 0.77% per annum based on the outstanding loan balance semi-annually over the term of the loan (subject to adjustment based upon our credit ratings) or (2)\\xa0an upfront fee of 2.35% to 2.37% of the maximum loan amount. We amortize the fees that are paid upfront over the life of the loan and those that are paid semi-annually over each respective payment period. Prior to the loan being drawn, we present these fees within Other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Once the loan is drawn, such fees are classified as a discount to the related loan, or contra-liability account, within Current portion of long-term debt or Long-term debt. In our consolidated statements of cash flows, we classify these fees within Amortization of debt issuance costs.Under certain of our agreements, the contractual interest rate, facility fee and/or export credit agency fee vary with our debt rating.The unsecured senior notes and senior debentures are not redeemable prior to maturity, except that certain series may be redeemed upon the payment of a make-whole premium.Finance LeasesSilversea Cruises operates two ships, the Silver Whisper and Silver Explorer, under finance leases. The finance  lease for the Silver Whisper will expire in 2022, subject to an option to purchase the ship, and the finance lease for the Silver Explorer will expire in 2021, subject to an option to extend the lease for up to an additional six years. The total aggregate amount of the finance lease liabilities recorded for these ships at the acquisition date was $82.8 million. The lease payments on the Silver Whisper are subject to adjustments based on the LIBOR rate. Refer to Note 3.

LeasesOur operating leases primarily relate to preferred berthing arrangements, real estate and shipboard equipment and are included within Operating lease right-of-use assets, and Long-term operating lease liabilities with the current portion of the liability included within Current portion of operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of December\\xa031, 2019. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. We recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Refer to Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for further information on the adoption of ASC 842. Finance leases are included within Property and equipment, net and Long-term debt, with the current portion of the debt reported within Current portion of debt, in our consolidated balance sheets. Our finance leases include two ships, Silver Whisper and Silver Explorer, operated by Silversea Cruises. The finance lease for Silver Whisper will expire in 2022, subject to an option to purchase the ship, and the finance lease for Silver Explorer will expire in 2021, subject to an option to extend the lease for up to an additional 6 years. In June 2019, the Company entered into a new master lease agreement (“Master Lease”) with Miami-Dade County relating to the buildings and surrounding land located at its Miami headquarters, which are classified as finance leases in accordance with ASC 842. Prior to entering into the Master Lease, the buildings were classified as operating lease assets. The finance lease for the buildings and land will expire in 2072, which includes an initial 43 years lease term and two five-year options to extend the lease. We consider the possibility of exercising the two five-year options reasonably certain.For some of our real estate leases and berthing agreements, we do have the option to extend our current lease term. For those lease agreements with renewal options, the renewal periods for real estate leases range from one to 10 years and the renewal periods for berthing agreements range from one year to 20 years. Generally, we do not include renewal options as a component of our present value calculation for berthing agreements. However, for certain real estate leases, we include them. Additionally, we do have a residual value guarantee associated with our lease of a terminal at PortMiami in Miami, Florida that approximates a percentage of cost of the asset as of the inception of the lease. We consider the possibility of incurring costs associated with the residual value guarantee to be remote.As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments. We estimate our incremental borrowing rates based on LIBOR and U.S. Treasury note rates corresponding to lease terms increased by the Company’s credit risk spread and reduced by the estimated impact of collateral. We used the incremental borrowing rate as of the adoption date for operating leases that commenced prior to that date. In addition, we have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. However, for berthing agreements, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.Additionally, we bareboat charter to Pullmantur Holdings the vessels currently operated by its brands, which were retained by us following the sale of our 51% interest in Pullmantur Holdings in 2016. We account for the F-29bareboat charters of these vessels as operating leases for which we are the lessor.\\xa0 The remaining payments and term of these leases are immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.Supplemental balance sheet information for leases was as follows (in thousands):As of December 31, 2019Lease assets:Finance lease right-of-use assets, net:Property and equipment, gross$376,159\\xa0\\xa0Accumulated depreciation(57,955)\\xa0Property and equipment, net318,204\\xa0\\xa0Operating lease right-of-use assets\\xa0\\xa0687,555\\xa0\\xa0Total lease assets$1,005,759\\xa0\\xa0Lease liabilities:Finance lease liabilities:Current portion of debt$33,561\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Long-term debt  196,697\\xa0\\xa0Total finance lease liabilities230,258\\xa0\\xa0Operating lease liabilities:Current portion of operating lease liabilities\\xa0\\xa096,976\\xa0\\xa0Long-term operating lease liabilities\\xa0\\xa0601,641\\xa0\\xa0Total operating lease liabilities698,617\\xa0\\xa0Total lease liabilities$928,875\\xa0\\xa0The components of lease expense were as follows (in thousands):Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) ClassificationTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2019Lease costs:Operating lease costsCommission, transportation and other$76,226\\xa0\\xa0Operating lease costsOther operating expenses27,868\\xa0\\xa0Operating lease costsMarketing, selling and administrative expenses18,837\\xa0\\xa0Finance lease costs:Amortization of right-of-use-assetsDepreciation and amortization expenses22,044\\xa0\\xa0Interest on lease liabilitiesInterest expense, net of interest capitalized8,355\\xa0\\xa0Total lease costs$153,330\\xa0\\xa0In addition, certain of our berth agreements include variable lease costs based on the number of passengers berthed.

During the construction period, SMBC funded the costs of the terminal’s construction and land lease. Once the terminal was substantially completed, we commenced operating and leasing the terminal from SMBC for a five-year term. We determined that the lease arrangement between SMBC and us should be accounted for as an operating lease.Note 11. Redeemable\\xa0Noncontrolling\\xa0InterestIn connection with the acquisition of Silversea Cruises, we recorded a redeemable noncontrolling interest of $537.8 million due to the put options held by HCH. The put options may require us to purchase HCH\\'s remaining interest, or 33.3% of Silversea Cruises, upon the occurrence or nonoccurrence of certain future events that are not solely within our control.

During the first quarter of 2017, we also paid a cash dividend on our common stock of $0.48 per share which was declared during the fourth quarter of 2016.Common Stock Repurchase ProgramIn May 2018, our board of directors authorized a 24-month common stock repurchase program for up to $1.0 billion. The timing and number of shares to be repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price and market conditions. Repurchases under the program may be made at management\\'s discretion from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased 0.9 million shares of our common stock under this program, for a total of $99.6 million, in open market transactions that were recorded within Treasury stock in our consolidated balance sheets. As of December\\xa031, 2019, we have $600.0 million that remains available for future stock repurchase transactions under our Board authorized program.Note\\xa013. Stock-Based Employee CompensationWe currently have awards outstanding under one stock-based compensation plan, our 2008 Equity Plan, which provides for awards to our officers, directors and key employees. The plan consists of a 2008 Equity Plan, as amended, provides for the issuance of up to 14,000,000 shares of our common stock pursuant to grants of (i)\\xa0incentive and non-qualified stock options, (ii)\\xa0stock appreciation rights, (iii)\\xa0stock awards (including time-based and/or performance-based stock awards) and (iv)\\xa0restricted stock units (including time-based and performance-based restricted stock units). During any calendar year, no one individual (other than non-employee members of our board of directors) may be granted awards of more than 500,000 shares and no non-employee member of our board of directors may be granted awards with a value in excess of $500,000 at the grant date. Options and restricted stock units outstanding as of December\\xa031, 2019 generally vest in equal installments over four years from the date of grant. In addition, performance shares and performance share units generally vest in three years. With certain limited exceptions, awards are forfeited if the recipient ceases to be an employee before the shares vest. Prior to 2012, our officers received a combination of stock options and restricted stock units. Beginning in 2012, our officers instead receive their long-term incentive awards through a combination of performance share units and restricted stock units. Each performance share unit award is expressed as a target number of performance share units based upon the fair market value of our common stock on the date the award is issued. The actual number of shares underlying each award (not to exceed 200% of the target number of performance share units) will be determined based upon the Company\\'s achievement of a specified performance target range. In 2019, we issued a target number of 187,924 performance share units, which will vest approximately three years following the award issue date. The performance payout of these grants will be based on return on our invested capital (\"ROIC\") and F-33Table of ContentsROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)earnings per share (“EPS”) for the year ended December\\xa031, 2021, as may be adjusted by the Talent and Compensation Committee of our board of directors in early 2022 for events that are outside of management\\'s control. Beginning in 2016, our senior officers meeting certain minimum age and service criteria receive their long-term incentive awards through a combination of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units. The restricted stock awards are subject to both performance and time-based vesting criteria while the restricted stock units are subject only to time-based vesting criteria. Each restricted stock award is issued in an amount equal to 200% of the target number of shares underlying the award based upon the fair market value of our common stock on the date the award is issued. Dividends accrue (but do not get paid) on the restricted stock awards during the vesting period, with the accrued amounts to be paid out following vesting only on the number of shares underlying the award which actually vest based on satisfaction of the performance criteria. The actual number of shares that vest (not to exceed 200% of the shares) will be determined based upon the Company\\'s achievement of a specified performance target range. In 2019, we issued 194,486 restricted stock awards, representing 200% of the target number of shares underlying the award, all of which are considered issued and outstanding from the date of issuance, however; grantees will only retain those shares earned as the result of the Company achieving the performance goals during the measurement period. The performance payout of the 2019 awards will be based on ROIC and EPS for the year ended December\\xa031, 2021, as may be adjusted by the Talent and Compensation Committee of our board of directors in early 2022 for events that are outside of management\\'s control.On January 24, 2018, the Company issued a one-time bonus award for all non-officer employees. These awards vest, in equal installments, over the 3 years following the award issue date. For shoreside eligible employees, awards were issued as equity-settled restricted stock units. We also provide an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\") to facilitate the purchase by employees of up to 1,300,000 shares of common stock in the aggregate. Offerings to employees are made on a quarterly basis. Subject to certain limitations, the purchase price for each share of common stock is equal to 85% of the average of the market prices of the common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on the first business day of the purchase period and the last business day of each month of the purchase period. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, 91,586, 74,100 and 51,989 shares of our common stock were purchased under the ESPP at a weighted-average price of $98.20, $97.50 and $93.15, respectively.Total compensation expense recognized for employee stock-based compensation for the years ended December\\xa031, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was as follows (in thousands):Employee Stock-Based CompensationClassification of expense201920182017Marketing, selling and administrative expenses$75,930\\xa0\\xa0$46,061\\xa0\\xa0$69,459\\xa0\\xa0Total compensation expense$75,930\\xa0\\xa0$46,061\\xa0\\xa0$69,459\\xa0\\xa0The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

We estimate the fair value of each performance share when the grant is authorized and the related service period has commenced. We remeasure the fair value of our performance shares in each subsequent reporting period until the grant date has occurred, which is the date when the performance conditions are satisfied. We recognize compensation cost over the vesting period based on the probability of the service and performance conditions being achieved adjusted for each subsequent fair value measurement until the grant date.

Following the vesting date, the restrictions will lift with respect to the number of shares for which the performance criteria was met and any excess shares will be canceled. Dividends will accrue on the issued restricted shares during the vesting period, but will not be paid to the recipient until the awards vest and the final number of shares underlying the award is determined, at which point, the dividends will be paid in cash only on the earned shares. We estimate the fair value of each restricted stock award when the grant is authorized and the related service period has commenced. We remeasure the fair value of these restricted stock awards in each subsequent reporting period until the grant date has occurred, which is the date when the performance conditions are satisfied.

Retirement PlanWe maintain a defined contribution plan covering shoreside employees. Effective January 1, 2016, we commenced annual, non-elective contributions to the plan on behalf of all eligible participants equal to 3% of participants\\' eligible earnings. Remaining annual contributions to the plan are discretionary and are based on fixed percentages of participants\\' salaries and years of service, not to exceed certain maximums. Contribution expenses were $21.2 million, $18.9 million and $17.4 million for the years ended December\\xa031, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Note\\xa016. Income TaxesWe are subject to corporate income taxes in countries where we have operations or subsidiaries. We and the majority of our ship-operating and vessel-owning subsidiaries are currently exempt from U.S. corporate income tax on U.S. source income from the international operation of ships pursuant to Section\\xa0883 of the Internal Revenue Code. Regulations under Section\\xa0883 have limited the activities that are considered the international operation of a ship or incidental thereto. Accordingly, our provision for U.S. federal and state income taxes includes taxes on certain activities not considered incidental to the international operation of our ships.Additionally, one of our ship-operating subsidiaries is subject to tax under the tonnage tax regime of the United Kingdom. Under this regime, income from qualifying activities is subject to corporate income tax, but the tax is computed by reference to the tonnage of the ship or ships registered under the relevant provisions of the tax regimes (the \"relevant shipping profits\"), which replaces the regular taxable income base. Income from activities not considered qualifying activities, which we do not consider significant, remains subject to United-Kingdom corporate income tax.Income tax expense for items not qualifying under Section\\xa0883, tonnage tax and income taxes for the remainder of our subsidiaries was approximately $32.6 million, $20.9 million and $18.3 million for the years ended December\\xa031, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and was recorded within Other income (expense). In addition, all interest expense and penalties related to income tax liabilities are classified as income tax expense within Other income (expense).For a majority of our subsidiaries, we do not expect to incur income taxes on future distributions of undistributed earnings. Accordingly, no deferred income taxes have been provided for the distribution of these earnings. Where we do expect to incur income taxes on future distributions of undistributed earnings, we have provided for deferred taxes, which we do not consider significant to our operations. As of December\\xa031, 2019, the Company had deferred tax assets, for foreign net operating losses (“NOLs”) of $25.1 million. We have provided a full valuation allowance for these NOLs. $17.6 million of the NOLs are subject to expire between 2020 and 2025. F-37Table of ContentsROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)Our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities and corresponding valuation allowances related to our operations were not material as of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018.We regularly review deferred tax assets for recoverability based on our history of earnings, expectations of future earnings, and tax planning strategies. Realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income to support the amount of deferred taxes. A valuation allowance is recorded in those circumstances in which we conclude it is not more-likely-than-not we will recover the deferred tax assets prior to their expiration. Note 17.

The Monte-Carlo simulation is a generally accepted statistical technique used to generate a defined number of valuation paths in order to develop a reasonable estimate of fair value. Refer to Note 3. Business Combination for further information on the Silversea Cruises acquisition. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a contingent consideration expense of $18.4 million within Other (expense) income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).The reported fair values are based on a variety of factors and assumptions. Accordingly, the fair values may not represent actual values of the financial instruments that could have been realized as of December\\xa031, 2019 or F-40Table of ContentsROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)2018, or that will be realized in the future, and do not include expenses that could be incurred in an actual sale or settlement.We have master International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) agreements in place with our derivative instrument counterparties. These ISDA agreements generally provide for final close out netting with our counterparties for all positions in the case of default or termination of the ISDA agreement. We have determined that our ISDA agreements provide us with rights of setoff on the fair value of derivative instruments in a gain position and those in a loss position with the same counterparty. We have elected not to offset such derivative instrument fair values in our consolidated balance sheets.See Credit Related Contingent Features for further discussion on contingent collateral requirements for our derivative instruments.The following table presents information about the Company’s offsetting of financial assets under master netting agreements with derivative counterparties (in thousands):Gross Amounts not Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet that are Subject to Master Netting AgreementsAs of December 31, 2019As of December 31, 2018Gross Amount of Derivative Assets Presented in the Consolidated Balance SheetGross Amount of Eligible Offsetting Recognized Derivative LiabilitiesCash Collateral ReceivedNet Amount of Derivative AssetsGross Amount of Derivative Assets Presented in the Consolidated Balance SheetGross Amount of Eligible Offsetting Recognized Derivative AssetsCash Collateral ReceivedNet Amount of Derivative AssetsDerivatives subject to master netting agreements$39,994\\xa0\\xa0$(39,994)\\xa0$—\\xa0\\xa0$—\\xa0\\xa0$65,297\\xa0\\xa0$(60,303)\\xa0$—\\xa0\\xa0$4,994\\xa0\\xa0Total$39,994\\xa0\\xa0$(39,994)\\xa0$—\\xa0\\xa0$—\\xa0\\xa0$65,297\\xa0\\xa0$(60,303)\\xa0$—\\xa0\\xa0$4,994\\xa0\\xa0The following table presents information about the Company’s offsetting of financial liabilities under master netting agreements with derivative counterparties (in thousands):Gross Amounts not Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet that are Subject to Master Netting AgreementsAs of December 31, 2019As of December 31, 2018Gross Amount of Derivative Liabilities Presented in the Consolidated Balance SheetGross Amount of Eligible Offsetting Recognized Derivative AssetsCash Collateral PledgedNet Amount of Derivative LiabilitiesGross Amount of Derivative Liabilities Presented in the Consolidated Balance SheetGross Amount of Eligible Offsetting Recognized Derivative LiabilitiesCash Collateral PledgedNet Amount of Derivative LiabilitiesDerivatives subject to master netting agreements$(257,728)\\xa0$39,994\\xa0\\xa0$—\\xa0\\xa0$(217,734)\\xa0$(201,812)\\xa0$60,303\\xa0\\xa0$—\\xa0\\xa0$(141,509)\\xa0Total$(257,728)\\xa0$39,994\\xa0\\xa0$—\\xa0\\xa0$(217,734)\\xa0$(201,812)\\xa0$60,303\\xa0\\xa0$—\\xa0\\xa0$(141,509)\\xa0Derivative InstrumentsWe are exposed to market risk attributable to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We try to mitigate these risks through a combination of our normal operating and financing activities and through the use of derivative financial instruments pursuant to our hedging practices and policies. The financial impact of these hedging instruments is primarily offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures being hedged. We achieve this by closely matching the notional amount, term and conditions of the derivative instrument with the underlying risk being hedged. Although certain of our derivative financial instruments do not qualify or are not accounted for under hedge accounting, our objective is not to hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. F-41Table of ContentsROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)We enter into various forward, swap and option contracts to manage our interest rate exposure and to limit our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. These instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value and the vast majority are designated as hedges. We also use non-derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of our net investment in our foreign operations and investments.At inception of the hedge relationship, a derivative instrument that hedges the exposure to changes in the fair value of a firm commitment or a recognized asset or liability is designated as a fair value hedge. A derivative instrument that hedges a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows related to a recognized asset or liability is designated as a cash flow hedge.Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges are offset against changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments. Gains and losses on derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss until the underlying hedged transactions are recognized in earnings. The foreign currency transaction gain or loss of our non-derivative financial instruments and the changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges of our net investment in foreign operations and investments are recognized as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss along with the associated foreign currency translation adjustment of the foreign operation or investment, with the amortization of excluded components affecting earnings.On an ongoing basis, we assess whether derivatives used in hedging transactions are \"highly effective\" in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flow of hedged items. For our net investment hedges, we use the dollar offset method to measure effectiveness. For all other hedging programs, we use the long-haul method to assess hedge effectiveness using regression analysis for each hedge relationship. The methodology for assessing hedge effectiveness is applied on  a consistent basis for each one of our hedging programs (i.e.,\\xa0interest rate, foreign currency ship construction, foreign currency net investment and fuel). For our regression analyses, we use an observation period of up to three years, utilizing market data relevant to the hedge horizon of each hedge relationship. High effectiveness is achieved when a statistically valid relationship reflects a high degree of offset and correlation between the changes in the fair values of the derivative instrument and the hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or hedge accounting is discontinued, any change in fair value of the derivative since the last date at which it was determined to be effective is recognized in earnings. Cash flows from derivative instruments that are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the underlying hedged items. In the event that hedge accounting is discontinued, cash flows subsequent to the date of discontinuance are classified within investing activities. Cash flows from derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments are classified as investing activities.We consider the classification of the underlying hedged item’s cash flows in determining the classification for the designated derivative instrument’s cash flows. We classify derivative instrument cash flows from hedges of benchmark interest rate or hedges of fuel expense as operating activities due to the nature of the hedged item. Likewise, we classify derivative instrument cash flows from hedges of foreign currency risk on our newbuild ship payments as investing activities.Interest Rate RiskOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to our debt obligations including future interest payments. At December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, approximately 62.1% and 59.1%, respectively, of our debt was effectively fixed. We use interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements and to manage our interest expense.Market risk associated with our fixed rate debt is the potential increase in fair value resulting from a decrease in interest rates.\\xa0We use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our fixed-rate debt to a floating-rate basis to manage this risk. At December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, we maintained interest rate swap agreements on the following fixed-rate debt instruments:F-42Table of ContentsROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)Debt InstrumentSwap Notional as of December 31, 2019 (In thousands)MaturityDebt Fixed RateSwap Floating Rate: LIBOR plusAll-in Swap Floating Rate as of December 31, 2019Oasis of the Seas term loan$70,000\\xa0\\xa0October 20215.41%\\xa0\\xa03.87%\\xa0\\xa05.80%\\xa0\\xa0Unsecured senior notes650,000\\xa0\\xa0November 20225.25%\\xa0\\xa03.63%\\xa0\\xa05.54%\\xa0\\xa0$720,000\\xa0\\xa0These interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges.Market risk associated with our long-term floating rate debt is the potential increase in interest expense from an increase in interest rates.\\xa0We use interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a portion of our floating-rate debt to a fixed-rate basis to manage this risk.

The anticipated unsecured term loan for the financing of Odyssey of the Seas is expected to be drawn in October 2020.These interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges.The notional amount of interest rate swap agreements related to outstanding debt and our current unfunded financing arrangements as of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018 was $3.5 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Derivative InstrumentsOur primary exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to our ship construction contracts denominated in Euros, our foreign currency denominated debt and our international business operations. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage portions of the exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. As of December\\xa031, 2019, the aggregate cost of our ships on order, was $14.8 billion, of which we had deposited $881.5 million as of such date. These amounts do not include any ships placed on order that are contingent upon completion of conditions precedent and/or financing, any ships on order by our Partner Brands and any ships on order placed by Silversea Cruises during the reporting lag period. Refer to Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies, for further information on our ships on order. At December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, approximately 65.9% and 53.5%, respectively, of the aggregate cost of the ships under construction was exposed to fluctuations in the Euro exchange rate. Our foreign currency forward contract agreements are accounted for as cash flow or net investment hedges depending on the designation of the related hedge.On a regular basis, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and, from time to time, we utilize cross-currency swap agreements and collar options to minimize the volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than our functional currency or the functional F-43Table of ContentsROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)currencies of our foreign subsidiaries. During the year ended December\\xa031, 2019, we maintained an average of approximately $689.7 million of these foreign currency forward contracts. These instruments are not designated as hedging instruments. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, changes in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts resulted in gains (losses) of $1.4 million, $(62.4) million and $62.0 million, respectively, which offset gains (losses) arising from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in those same years of $0.4 million, $57.6 million and $(75.6) million, respectively. These amounts were recognized in earnings within Other income (expense) in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).We consider our investments in our foreign operations to be denominated in relatively stable currencies and of a long-term nature. As of December\\xa031, 2019, we maintained foreign currency forward contracts and designated them as hedges of a portion of our net investments primarily in TUI Cruises of €173.0 million, or approximately $194.2 million based on the exchange rate at December\\xa031, 2019. These forward currency contracts mature in October 2021.The notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts, excluding the forward contracts entered into to minimize remeasurement volatility, as of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018 was $2.9 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively.Non-Derivative InstrumentsWe also address the exposure of our investments in foreign operations by denominating a portion of our debt in our subsidiaries\\' and investments\\' functional currencies and designating it as a hedge of these subsidiaries and investments. We had designated debt as a hedge of our net investments primarily in TUI Cruises of €319.0 million, or approximately $358.1 million, as of December\\xa031, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, we had designated debt as a hedge of our net investments primarily in TUI Cruises of €280.0 million, or approximately $320.2 million.Fuel Price RiskOur exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices relates primarily to the consumption of fuel on our ships. We use fuel swap agreements to mitigate the financial impact of fluctuations in fuel prices.Our fuel swap agreements are generally accounted for as cash flow hedges. At December\\xa031, 2019, we have hedged the variability in future cash flows for certain forecasted fuel transactions occurring through 2023. As of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, we had the following outstanding fuel swap agreements as hedges of our fuel exposure:Fuel Swap AgreementsAs of December 31, 2019As of December 31, 2018(metric tons)2019—\\xa0\\xa0856,800\\xa0\\xa02020830,500\\xa0\\xa0830,500\\xa0\\xa02021488,900\\xa0\\xa0488,900\\xa0\\xa02022322,900\\xa0\\xa0322,900\\xa0\\xa0202382,400\\xa0\\xa0—\\xa0\\xa0F-44Table of ContentsROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)Fuel Swap AgreementsAs of December 31, 2019As of December 31, 2018(% hedged)Projected fuel purchases for year:2019—\\xa0\\xa058\\xa0%202054\\xa0%54\\xa0%202130\\xa0%28\\xa0%202219\\xa0%19\\xa0%20235\\xa0%—\\xa0\\xa0At December\\xa031, 2019 there was no material estimated unrealized net loss associated with our cash flow hedges pertaining to fuel swap agreements to be reclassified to earnings from Accumulated other comprehensive loss within the next twelve months when compared to $26.8 million at December\\xa031, 2018.

collateral if our Standard\\xa0& Poor\\'s and Moody\\'s credit ratings are below specified levels. Generally, if on the fifth anniversary of executing a derivative instrument or on any succeeding fifth-year anniversary our credit ratings for our senior unsecured debt were to be rated below BBB- by Standard\\xa0& Poor\\'s and Baa3 by Moody\\'s, then the counterparty may periodically demand that we post collateral in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the net market value of all derivative transactions with such counterparty that have reached their fifth year anniversary, to the extent negative, and (ii) the applicable minimum call amount. The amount of collateral required to be posted following such event will change as, and to the extent, our net liability position increases or decreases by more than the applicable minimum call amount. If our credit rating for our senior unsecured debt is subsequently equal to, or above BBB- by Standard\\xa0& Poor\\'s or Baa3 by Moody\\'s, then any collateral posted at such time will be released to us and we will no longer be required to post collateral unless we meet the collateral trigger requirement, generally, at the next fifth-year anniversary. At December\\xa031, 2019, five of our interest rate derivative instruments had reached their fifth anniversary; however, our senior unsecured debt credit rating was Baa2 by Moody\\'s and BBB- by Standard\\xa0& Poor\\'s and, accordingly, we were not required to post any collateral as of such date. Note\\xa019. Commitments and ContingenciesShip Purchase ObligationsOur future capital commitments consist primarily of new ship orders. As of December\\xa031, 2019, we had one Quantum-class ship, two Oasis-class ships and three ships of a new generation, known as our Icon-class, on order F-48Table of ContentsROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)for our Royal Caribbean International brand with an aggregate capacity of approximately 32,400 berths. As of December\\xa031, 2019, we had three Edge-class ships on order for our Celebrity brand with an aggregate capacity of approximately 9,400 berths. Additionally as of December\\xa031, 2019, we had five ships on order with an aggregate capacity of approximately 2,400 berths for our Silversea Cruises brand. The following provides further information on recent developments with respect to our ship orders.During 2017, we entered into credit agreements for the unsecured financing of the two Icon-class ships for up to 80% of each ship’s contract price. For each ship, the official Finnish export credit agency, Finnvera plc, has agreed to guarantee 100% of a substantial majority of the financing to the lenders, with a smaller portion of the financing to be 95% guaranteed by Euler Hermes, the official German export credit agency. The maximum loan amount under each facility is not to exceed €1.4 billion, or approximately $1.6 billion, based on the exchange rate at December\\xa031, 2019. Interest on approximately 75% of each loan will accrue at a fixed rate of 3.56% and 3.76% for the first and the second Icon-class ships, respectively, and the balance will accrue interest at a floating rate ranging from LIBOR plus 1.10% to 1.15% and LIBOR plus 1.15% to 1.20% for the first and the second Icon-class ships, respectively. Each loan will amortize semi-annually and will mature 12 years following delivery of each ship. The first and second Icon-class ships will each have a capacity of approximately 5,600 berths and are expected to enter service in the second quarters of 2022 and 2024, respectively. During 2017, we entered into credit agreements for the unsecured financing of the third and fourth Edge-class ships and the fifth Oasis-class ship for up to 80% of each ship’s contract price through facilities to be guaranteed 100% by Bpifrance Assurance Export, the official export credit agency of France. Under these financing arrangements, we have the right, but not the obligation, to satisfy the obligations to be incurred upon delivery and acceptance of each ship under the shipbuilding contract by assuming, at delivery and acceptance, the debt indirectly incurred by the shipbuilder during the construction of each ship. The maximum loan amount under each facility is not to exceed €684.2 million in the case of the third Edge-class ship and the United States dollar equivalent of €714.6 million and €1.1 billion in the case of the fourth Edge-class ship and fifth Oasis-class ship, or approximately $802.1 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, based on the exchange rate at December\\xa031, 2019. The loans will amortize semi-annually and will mature 12 years following delivery of each ship. Interest on the loans will accrue at a fixed rate of 1.28% for the third Edge-class ship and at a fixed rate of 3.18% for both, the fourth Edge-class ship and the fifth Oasis-class ship. The third and fourth Edge-class ships, each of which will have a capacity of approximately 3,250, are expected to enter service in the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2022, respectively. The fifth Oasis-class ship will have a capacity of approximately 5,700 berths and is expected to enter service in the second quarter of 2021.During 2016, we entered into credit agreements for the unsecured financing of our first two Edge-class ships for up to 80% of each ship’s contract price through facilities to be guaranteed 100% by Bpifrance Assurance Export, the official export credit agency of France. Celebrity Edge, the first Edge-class ship for our Celebrity Cruises brand, entered service in December 2018. For further information on the financing agreement for this ship, refer to Note 9. Debt. The second Edge-class ship will have a capacity of approximately 2,900 berths and is expected to enter service in the first quarter of 2020. Under the financing arrangement for the second Edge-class ship, we have the right, but not the obligation, to satisfy the obligations to be incurred upon delivery and acceptance of the vessel under the shipbuilding contract by assuming, at delivery and acceptance, the debt indirectly incurred by the shipbuilder during the construction of the ship. The maximum loan amount under the facility for the second Edge-class ship delivery is not to exceed the United States dollar equivalent of €627.1 million, or approximately $704.0 million, respectively, based on the exchange rate at December\\xa031, 2019. The loan will amortize semi-annually and will mature 12 years following delivery of the ship. Interest on the loan will accrue at a fixed rate of 3.23%.During 2015, we entered into a credit agreement for the unsecured financing of the fifth Quantum-class ship for up to 80% of the ship’s contract price, through a facility to be guaranteed 95% by Euler Hermes, official export credit agency of Germany. Hermes has agreed to guarantee to the lender payment of 95% of the financing. The ship will have a capacity of approximately 4,200 berths and is expected to enter service in the fourth quarter of 2020. This credit agreement makes available to us an unsecured term loan in an amount up to the United States dollar equivalent of €777.5 million, or approximately $872.7 million, based on the exchange rate at December\\xa031, 2019.

At our election, prior to delivery of the ship, interest on the loans will accrue either (1) at a fixed rate of 3.45% (inclusive of the applicable margin) or (2) at a floating rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.95%.

Under the financing arrangement, we have the right, but not the obligation, to satisfy the obligations to be incurred upon delivery and acceptance of the ship under the shipbuilding contract by assuming, at delivery and acceptance, the debt indirectly incurred by the shipbuilder during the construction of the ship. The maximum loan amount under the facility is not to exceed the United States dollar equivalent of €1.3 billion, or approximately $1.5 billion based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2019. The loan will amortize semi-annually and will mature 12 years following delivery of the ship.  Interest on the loan will accrue at a fixed rate of 3.00% (inclusive of margin). The sixth Oasis-class ship will have a capacity of approximately 5,700 berths and is scheduled for delivery in the fall of 2023.In December 2019, we entered into a credit agreement for the unsecured financing of the third Icon-class ship for up to 80% of the ship’s contract price. Finnvera plc, the official export credit agency of Finland, has agreed to guarantee 95% of the substantial majority of the financing, with a smaller portion of the financing to be 95% guaranteed by Euler Hermes, the official German export credit agency. The maximum loan amount under the facility is not to exceed the United States dollar equivalent of €1.4\\xa0billion, or approximately $1.6\\xa0billion based on the exchange rate at December 31, 2019.

The balance of the loan will accrue interest at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 0.85%. The third Icon-class ship will have a capacity of approximately 5,600 berths and is scheduled for delivery in the second quarter of 2025. As of December\\xa031, 2019, the aggregate cost of our ships on order, not including any ships on order by our Partner Brands and the Silversea Cruises ships that remain contingent upon final documentation and financing, was approximately $14.8 billion, of which we had deposited $881.5 million as of such date. Approximately 65.9% of the aggregate cost was exposed to fluctuations in the Euro exchange rate at December\\xa031, 2019. Refer to Note\\xa018. Fair Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments for further information.In addition, as of December\\xa031, 2019, we have an agreement in place with Chantiers de l’Atlantique to build an additional Edge-class ship for delivery in the 4th quarter of 2024, which is contingent upon completion of conditions precedent and financing. Litigation On August 27, 2019, two lawsuits were filed against Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida under Title III of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, also known as the Helms-Burton Act. The complaint filed by Havana Docks Corporation alleges it holds an interest in the Havana Cruise Port Terminal and the complaint filed by Javier Garcia-Bengochea alleges that he holds an interest in the Port of Santiago, Cuba, both of which were expropriated by the Cuban Government. The complaints further allege that Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. trafficked in those properties by embarking and disembarking passengers at these facilities. The plaintiffs seek all available statutory remedies, including the value of the expropriated property, plus interest, treble damages, attorneys’ fees and costs.  Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. filed its answer to each complaint on October 4, 2019. We believe we have meritorious defenses to the claims, and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against them. We believe that it is unlikely that the outcome of these matters will have F-51Table of ContentsROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)a material adverse impact to our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and there can be no assurances that the final outcome of this case will not be material.We are routinely involved in other claims typical within the travel and tourism industry. The majority of these claims are covered by insurance. We believe the outcome of such claims, net of expected insurance recoveries, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations and cash flows.OtherSome of the contracts that we enter into include indemnification provisions that obligate us to make payments to the counterparty if certain events occur. These contingencies generally relate to changes in taxes, increased lender capital costs and other similar costs. The indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and are entered into in the normal course of business. There are no stated or notional amounts included in the indemnification clauses and we are not able to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments, if any, under these indemnification clauses. We have not been required to make any payments under such indemnification clauses in the past and, under current circumstances, we do not believe an indemnification in any material amount is probable.If any person acquires ownership of more than 50% of our common stock or, subject to certain exceptions, during any 24-month period, a majority of our board of directors is no longer comprised of individuals who were members of our board of directors on the first day of such period, we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under our credit facilities, which we may be unable to replace on similar terms. Our public debt securities also contain change of control provisions that would be triggered by a third-party acquisition of greater than 50% of our common stock coupled with a ratings downgrade. If this were to occur, it would have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations.At December\\xa031, 2019, we have future commitments to pay for our usage of certain port facilities, marine consumables, services and maintenance contracts as follows (in thousands):Year2020$202,879\\xa0\\xa02021137,840\\xa0\\xa0202257,096\\xa0\\xa0202314,596\\xa0\\xa020248,760\\xa0\\xa0Thereafter34,233\\xa0\\xa0$455,404\\xa0\\xa0Note 20. Restructuring ChargesFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred restructuring charges of $12.0 million in connection with our international sales and marketing strategy. For the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we did not incur restructuring charges. Centralization of Global Sales and Marketing StructureDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we implemented a strategy related to the restructuring and centralization of our international sales and marketing structure. Activities related to this strategy focused on moving from a multi-brand sales model to a brand dedicated sales model, which resulted in the consolidation of some of our international offices and personnel reorganization among our sales and marketing teams. The personnel reorganization resulted in the recognition of a liability for one-time termination benefits during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. We also incurred contract termination costs related to the closure of some of our international offices and other related costs consisting of legal and consulting fees to implement this initiative. As a F-52result of these actions, we incurred restructuring exit costs of $12.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which were reported within Marketing, selling and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). In 2020, we expect to incur additional immaterial costs as it relates to the restructuring activities of this strategy.The following table summarizes our restructuring exit costs  (in thousands):BeginningBalanceJanuary 1, 2019AccrualsPaymentsEnding Balance December 31, 2019CumulativeChargesIncurredTermination benefits—\\xa0\\xa0$8,880\\xa0\\xa0$491\\xa0\\xa0$8,389\\xa0\\xa0$8,880\\xa0\\xa0Contract termination costs—\\xa0\\xa0338\\xa0\\xa0—\\xa0\\xa0338\\xa0\\xa0338\\xa0\\xa0Other related costs—\\xa0\\xa02,808\\xa0\\xa023\\xa0\\xa02,785\\xa0\\xa02,808\\xa0\\xa0Total—\\xa0\\xa0$12,026\\xa0\\xa0$514\\xa0\\xa0$11,512\\xa0\\xa0$12,026\\xa0\\xa0Note\\xa021.

Caterpillar is also a leading U.S. exporter.\\xa0 Through a global network of independent dealers and direct sales of certain products, Caterpillar builds long-term relationships with customers around the world.\\xa0Currently, we have five operating segments, of which four are reportable segments and are described below.\\xa0\\xa0Categories of Business Organization\\xa01.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Machinery, Energy & Transportation — Represents the aggregate total of Construction Industries, Resource Industries, Energy & Transportation and All Other operating segment and related corporate items and eliminations.\\xa02.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Financial Products — Primarily includes the company’s Financial Products Segment.\\xa0 This category includes Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation (Cat Financial), Caterpillar Insurance Holdings Inc. (Insurance Services) and their respective subsidiaries.\\xa0Other information about our operations in 2019, including certain risks associated with our operations, is included in Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\\xa0Construction Industries\\xa0Our Construction Industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in infrastructure, forestry and building construction.\\xa0 The majority of machine sales in this segment are made in the heavy and general construction, rental, quarry and aggregates markets and mining.  \\xa0The nature of customer demand for construction machinery varies around the world.\\xa0 Customers in developing economies often prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions, while customers in developed economies generally weigh productivity and other performance criteria that contribute to lower owning and operating costs over the lifetime of the machine.\\xa0 To meet customer expectations in developing economies, Caterpillar developed differentiated product offerings that target customers in those markets, including our SEM brand machines.\\xa0 We believe that these customer-driven product innovations enable us to compete more effectively in developing economies.  The majority of Construction Industries\\' research and development spending in 2019 focused on the next generation of construction machines.\\xa0The competitive environment for construction machinery is characterized by some global competitors and many regional and specialized local competitors.\\xa0 Examples of global competitors include CASE (part of CNH Industrial N.V.), Deere Construction & Forestry (part of Deere & Company), Doosan Infracore Co., Ltd., Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., Hyundai Construction Equipment Co., Ltd., J.C. Bamford Excavators Ltd., Kobelco Construction Machinery (part of Kobe Steel, Ltd), Komatsu Ltd., Kubota Farm & Industrial Machinery (part of Kubota Corporation), and Volvo Construction Equipment (part of the Volvo Group).\\xa0 As an example of regional and local competitors, our competitors in China also include Guangxi LiuGong Machinery Co., Ltd., Longking Holdings Ltd., Sany Heavy Industry Co., Ltd., XCMG Group, Shandong Lingong Construction Machinery Co., Ltd. (SDLG, part of the Volvo Group) and Shantui Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., (part of Shandong Heavy Industry Group Co.).\\xa0 Each of these companies has varying product lines that compete with Caterpillar products, and each has varying degrees of regional focus.1Table of Contents\\xa0The Construction Industries product portfolio includes the following machines and related parts and work tools:\\xa0·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0asphalt pavers\\xa0·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0feller bunchers\\xa0·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0telehandlers·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0backhoe loaders\\xa0·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0harvesters\\xa0·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0small and medium·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0compactors\\xa0·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0knuckleboom loaders\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0track-type tractors·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0cold planers\\xa0·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0motorgraders\\xa0·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0track-type loaders·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 compact track and\\xa0·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 pipelayers\\xa0·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0wheel excavators\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0multi-terrain loaders\\xa0·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 road reclaimers\\xa0·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 compact, small and·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0mini, small, medium\\xa0·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 site prep tractors\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 medium wheel loaders\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 and large excavators\\xa0·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 skidders\\xa0·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0utility vehicles·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0forestry excavators\\xa0·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 skid steer loaders\\xa0\\xa0Resource Industries\\xa0The Resource Industries segment is primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in mining, heavy construction, quarry and aggregates, waste and material handling applications.\\xa0 Caterpillar offers a broad product range and services to deliver comprehensive solutions for our mining customers. We manufacture high productivity equipment for both surface and underground mining operations around the world.  Our equipment is used to extract and haul copper, iron ore, coal, oil sands, aggregates, gold and other minerals and ores.  In addition to equipment, Resource Industries also develops and sells technology products and services to provide customers fleet management systems, equipment management analytics and autonomous machine capabilities.  Customers in most markets place an emphasis on equipment that is highly productive, reliable and provides the lowest total cost of ownership over the life of the equipment.  In some developing markets, customers often prioritize purchase price in making their investment decisions.\\xa0 We believe our ability to control the integration and design of key machine components represents a competitive advantage. Our research and development efforts remain focused on providing customers the lowest total cost of ownership enabled through the highest quality, most productive products and services in the industry.The competitive environment for Resource Industries consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in several of the markets that we serve and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a more limited range of products, applications, and regional markets.\\xa0 Our global surface competitors include Deere Construction & Forestry (part of Deere & Company), Epiroc AB, Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Ltd., Komatsu Ltd., Liebherr-International AG, Sandvik AB, and Volvo Construction Equipment.\\xa0 Our global underground competitors include Epiroc AB, Komatsu Ltd., Sandvik AB and Zhengzhou Coal Mining Machinery Group Co., Ltd.

The product and services portfolio includes reciprocating engines, generator sets, marine propulsion systems, gas turbines and turbine-related services, the remanufacturing of Caterpillar engines and components and remanufacturing services for other companies, diesel-electric locomotives and other rail-related products and services and product support of on-highway vocational trucks for North America. 2Table of Contents\\xa0Regulatory emissions standards require us to continue to make investments as new products and new regulations are introduced.\\xa0 On-going compliance with these regulations remains a focus.\\xa0 Emissions compliance in developing markets is complex due to rapidly evolving and unique requirements where enforcement processes can often vary.\\xa0 We employ robust product development and manufacturing processes to help us comply with these regulations.\\xa0 \\xa0The competitive environment for reciprocating engines in marine, oil and gas, industrial and electric power generation systems along with turbines in oil and gas and electric power generation consists of a few larger global competitors that compete in a variety of markets that Caterpillar serves, and a substantial number of smaller companies that compete in a limited-size product range, geographic region and/or application.\\xa0 Principal global competitors include Cummins Inc., Deutz AG, INNIO, Rolls-Royce Power Systems and Wärtsilä Corp. \\xa0Other competitors, such as Fiat Industrial SpA (CNHI), GE Power, Kawasaki Heavy Industries Energy System & Plant Engineering, MAN Energy Solutions (VW), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Siemens Power and Gas,Volvo Penta AB, Weichai Power Co., Ltd., and other emerging market competitors compete in certain markets in which Caterpillar competes. An additional set of competitors, including Aggreko plc, Baker Hughes Co., Generac Holdings, Kohler Power Systems, and others, are primarily packagers who source engines and/or other components from domestic and international suppliers and market products regionally and internationally through a variety of distribution channels.\\xa0 In rail-related businesses, our global competitors include Alstom SA, Bombardier Transportation, CRRC Corp., LTD., The Greenbrier Companies, Siemens Mobility, Voestalpine AG, Vossloh AG and Wabtec Freight.\\xa0 We also compete with other companies on a more limited range of products, services and/or geographic regions.The Energy & Transportation portfolio includes the following products and related parts:•reciprocating engine powered generator sets•reciprocating engines supplied to the industrial industry as well as Caterpillar machinery•integrated systems used in the electric power generation industry•turbines, centrifugal gas compressors and related services•reciprocating engines and integrated systems and solutions for the marine and oil and gas industries•remanufactured reciprocating engines and components•diesel-electric locomotives and components and other rail-related products and servicesFinancial Products Segment\\xa0The business of our Financial Products Segment is primarily conducted by Cat Financial, Insurance Services and their respective subsidiaries.\\xa0 Cat Financial is a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Caterpillar Inc. and its primary business is to provide retail and wholesale financing alternatives for Caterpillar products to customers and dealers around the world.\\xa0 Retail financing is primarily comprised of the financing of Caterpillar equipment, machinery and engines. Cat Financial also provides financing for vehicles, power generation facilities and marine vessels that, in most cases, incorporate Caterpillar products. In addition to retail financing, Cat Financial provides wholesale financing to Caterpillar dealers and purchases short-term trade receivables from Caterpillar. The various financing plans offered by Cat Financial are primarily designed to increase the opportunity for sales of Caterpillar products and generate financing income for Cat Financial.\\xa0 A significant portion of Cat Financial’s activity is conducted in North America, with additional offices and subsidiaries in Latin America, Asia/Pacific, Europe, Africa and the Middle East. \\xa0For over 35 years, Cat Financial has been providing financing in the various markets in which it participates, contributing to its knowledge of asset values, industry trends, product structuring and customer needs.\\xa0In certain instances, Cat Financial’s operations are subject to supervision and regulation by state, federal and various foreign governmental authorities, and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions which, among other things, (i)\\xa0regulate credit granting activities and the administration of loans, (ii)\\xa0establish maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges, (iii)\\xa0require disclosures to customers and investors, (iv)\\xa0govern secured transactions, (v) set collection, foreclosure, repossession and other trade practices and (vi)\\xa0regulate the use and reporting of information related to a borrower’s credit experience.\\xa0 Cat Financial’s ability to comply with these and other governmental and legal requirements and restrictions affects its operations.Cat Financial’s retail loans (totaling 49 percent*) include:•Loans that allow customers and dealers to use their Caterpillar equipment or other assets as collateral to obtain financing (24 percent*).3Table of Contents•Installment sale contracts, which are equipment loans that enable customers to purchase equipment with a down payment or trade-in and structure payments over time (25 percent*).Cat Financial\\'s retail leases (totaling 35 percent*) include:•Finance (non-tax) leases, where the lessee for tax purposes is considered to be the owner of the equipment during the term of the lease, that either require or allow the customer to purchase the equipment for a fixed price at the end of the term (22 percent*).•Tax leases that are classified as either operating or finance leases for financial accounting purposes, depending on the characteristics of the lease.\\xa0 For tax purposes, Cat Financial is considered the owner of the equipment (12 percent*).•Governmental lease-purchase plans in the U.S. that offer low interest rates and flexible terms to qualified non-federal government agencies (1 percent*).Cat Financial also purchases short-term receivables from Caterpillar (14 percent*).\\xa0Cat Financial’s wholesale loans and leases (2 percent*) include inventory/rental programs, which provide assistance to dealers by financing their new Caterpillar inventory and rental fleets.\\xa0*Indicates the percentage of Cat Financial’s total portfolio at December\\xa031, 2019.\\xa0 We define total portfolio as total finance receivables (net of unearned income and allowance for credit losses) plus equipment on operating leases, less accumulated depreciation. For more information on the above and Cat Financial’s concentration of credit risk, please refer to Note\\xa07 — “Cat Financial Financing Activities” of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"_____________________________\\xa0Cat Financial operates in a highly competitive environment, with financing for users of Caterpillar equipment available through a variety of sources, principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies. Cat Financial’s competitors include, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited, Banc of America Leasing & Capital LLC, BNP Paribas Leasing Solutions Limited, Wells Fargo Equipment Finance Inc. and various other banks and finance companies.\\xa0 In addition, many of our manufacturing competitors own financial subsidiaries, such as John Deere Capital Corporation, Komatsu Financial L.P., Kubota Credit Corporation and Volvo Financial Services, which utilize below-market interest rate programs (funded by the manufacturer) to assist machine sales.\\xa0 Caterpillar and Cat Financial work together to provide a broad array of financial merchandising programs around the world to meet these competitive offers.\\xa0Cat Financial’s financial results are largely dependent upon the ability of Caterpillar dealers to sell equipment and customers’ willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements.\\xa0 Cat Financial is also affected by, among other things, the availability of funds from its financing sources, its cost of funds relative to its competitors and general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest rates.\\xa0Cat Financial has a match-funding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate) of its debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of its receivables portfolio within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis.\\xa0 In connection with that policy, Cat Financial uses interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the receivables portfolio. This matched funding reduces the volatility of margins between interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities, regardless of which direction interest rates move.  For more information regarding match funding, please see Note\\xa04 — “Derivative financial instruments and risk management” of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\\xa0 See also the risk factors associated with our financial products business included in Item 1 A. of this Form 10-K. In managing foreign currency risk for Cat Financial’s operations, the objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions, and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies.\\xa0 This policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between the assets and liabilities, and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies.\\xa04Table of ContentsCat Financial provides financing only when certain criteria are met. Credit decisions are based on a variety of credit quality factors including prior payment experience, customer financial information, credit-rating agency ratings, loan-to-value ratios and other internal metrics.  Cat Financial typically maintains a security interest in retail-financed equipment and requires physical damage insurance coverage on financed equipment.\\xa0 Cat Financial finances a significant portion of Caterpillar dealers’ sales and inventory of Caterpillar equipment throughout the world.\\xa0 Cat Financial’s competitive position is improved by marketing programs offered in conjunction with Caterpillar and/or Caterpillar dealers.\\xa0 Under these programs, Caterpillar, or the dealer, funds an amount at the outset of the transaction, which Cat Financial then recognizes as revenue over the term of the financing.\\xa0 We believe that these marketing programs provide Cat Financial a significant competitive advantage in financing Caterpillar products.\\xa0Caterpillar Insurance Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Caterpillar Insurance Holdings Inc., is a U.S. insurance company domiciled in Missouri and primarily regulated by the Missouri Department of Insurance.\\xa0 Caterpillar Insurance Company is licensed to conduct property and casualty insurance business in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Guam, and as such, is also regulated in those jurisdictions.\\xa0 The State of Missouri acts as the lead regulatory authority and monitors Caterpillar Insurance Company’s financial status to ensure that it is in compliance with minimum solvency requirements, as well as other financial ratios prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.\\xa0 Caterpillar Insurance Company is also licensed to conduct insurance business through a branch in Zurich, Switzerland and, as such, is regulated by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority.\\xa0Caterpillar Life Insurance Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Caterpillar, is a U.S. insurance company domiciled in Missouri and primarily regulated by the Missouri Department of Insurance.\\xa0 Caterpillar Life Insurance Company is licensed to conduct life and accident and health insurance business in 26 states and the District of Columbia and, as such, is also regulated in those jurisdictions.

Outside the United States, certain competitors enjoy competitive advantages inherent to operating in their home countries or regions.\\xa0Raw Materials and Component Products\\xa0We source our raw materials and manufactured components from suppliers both domestically and internationally. These purchases include unformed materials and rough and finished parts.\\xa0 Unformed materials include a variety of steel products, which are then cut or formed to shape and machined in our facilities. Rough parts include various sized steel and iron castings and forgings, which are machined to final specification levels inside our facilities. Finished parts are ready to assemble components, which are made either to Caterpillar specifications or to supplier developed specifications.\\xa0 We machine and assemble some of the components used in our machines, engines and power generation units and to support our after-market dealer parts sales. We also purchase various goods and services used in production, logistics, offices and product development processes.\\xa0 We maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facilities’ production needs while building long-term supplier relationships and leveraging enterprise spend.\\xa0 We expect our suppliers to maintain, at all times, industry-leading levels of quality and the ability to timely deliver raw materials and component products for our machine and engine products.\\xa0However, increases in demand have led to parts and components constraints across some products. We use a variety of agreements with suppliers to protect our intellectual property and processes to monitor and mitigate risks of the supply base causing a business disruption.\\xa0 The risks monitored include supplier financial viability, the ability to increase or decrease production levels, business continuity, quality and delivery.\\xa0Patents and Trademarks\\xa0We own a number of patents and trademarks, which have been obtained over a period of years and relate to the products we manufacture and the services we provide. These patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our business. We do not regard our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents.Order Backlog\\xa0The dollar amount of backlog believed to be firm was approximately $13.7 billion at December\\xa031, 2019 and $16.5 billion at December\\xa031, 2018. Compared with year-end 2018, the order backlog decreased across the three primary segments. Of the total backlog at December\\xa031, 2019, approximately $3.8 billion was not expected to be filled in 2020.\\xa0Dealers and Distributors\\xa0Our machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of dealers (dealer network), 46 located in the United States and 119 located outside the United States, serving 191 countries.\\xa0\\xa0Reciprocating engines are sold principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in products. Some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by our subsidiary Perkins Engines Company Limited are also sold through its worldwide network of 67 distributors covering 178 countries.  The FG Wilson branded electric power generation systems primarily manufactured by our subsidiary Caterpillar Northern Ireland Limited are sold through its worldwide network of 150 distributors covering 109 countries.\\xa0\\xa0Some of the large, medium speed reciprocating engines are also sold\\xa0under the MaK brand through a worldwide network of 20 distributors covering 130 countries.\\xa0\\xa0Our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products; however, in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers’ principal business.\\xa0 Some products, primarily turbines and locomotives, are sold directly to end customers through sales forces employed by the company.\\xa0 At times, these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives.  6Table of ContentsWhile the large majority of our worldwide dealers are independently owned and operated, we own and operate a dealership in Japan that covers approximately 80% of the Japanese market:  Nippon Caterpillar Division.  We are currently operating this Japanese dealer directly and its results are reported in the All Other operating segment.  There are also three independent dealers in the Southern Region of Japan.\\xa0For Caterpillar branded products, the company’s relationship with each of its independent dealers is memorialized in standard sales and service agreements.\\xa0 Pursuant to these agreements, the company grants the dealer the right to purchase and sell its products and to service the products in a specified geographic service territory.\\xa0 Prices to dealers are established by the company after receiving input from dealers on transactional pricing in the marketplace.\\xa0 The company also agrees to defend its intellectual property and to provide warranty and technical support to the dealer.\\xa0 The agreement further grants the dealer a non-exclusive license to use the company’s trademarks, service marks and brand names.\\xa0 In some instances, a separate trademark agreement exists between the company and a dealer.\\xa0In exchange for these rights, the agreement obligates the dealer to develop and promote the sale of the company’s products to current and prospective customers in the dealer’s service territory.\\xa0 Each dealer agrees to employ adequate sales and support personnel to market, sell and promote the company’s products, demonstrate and exhibit the products, perform the company’s product improvement programs, inform the company concerning any features that might affect the safe operation of any of the company’s products and maintain detailed books and records of the dealer’s financial condition, sales and inventories and make these books and records available at the company’s reasonable request.\\xa0These sales and service agreements are terminable at will by either party primarily upon 90 days written notice.\\xa0Employment\\xa0As of December\\xa031, 2019, we employed about 102,300 full-time persons of whom approximately 58,700 were located outside the United States.  In the United States, we employed approximately 43,600 employees, most of whom are at-will employees and, therefore, not subject to any type of employment contract or agreement.\\xa0 At select business units, certain highly specialized employees have been hired under employment contracts that specify a term of employment, pay and other benefits.\\xa0Full-Time\\xa0Employees\\xa0at\\xa0Year-End\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa0Inside U.S.43,600\\xa044,600\\xa0Outside U.S.58,700\\xa059,400\\xa0Total102,300\\xa0104,000\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0By Region:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0North America43,900\\xa044,900\\xa0EAME18,400\\xa018,000\\xa0Latin America16,400\\xa017,300\\xa0Asia/Pacific23,600\\xa023,800\\xa0Total102,300\\xa0104,000\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0As of December\\xa031, 2019, there were approximately 8,290 U.S. hourly production employees who were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions, including The United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW), The International Association of Machinists and The United Steelworkers. Approximately 6,880 of such employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with the UAW that expire on December 17, 2020 and March 1, 2023. Outside the United States, the company enters into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary.\\xa0The provisions of these agreements generally correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction.\\xa07Environmental Matters\\xa0The company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines. We have made, and will continue to make, significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards.\\xa0We are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws.\\xa0 When it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, the investigation, remediation, and operating and maintenance costs of the remedial action are accrued against our earnings.\\xa0 Costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site, including available technologies, current applicable laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience.  Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, we accrue the minimum.  Where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved, we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs.  In formulating the estimate of probable costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others.\\xa0 We reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis.  The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in the line item \"Accrued expenses\" in Statement 3 — \"Consolidated Financial Position at December 31\" of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"  There is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all the sites in the aggregate, will be required.

Although we believe we have been prudent in our assumptions, any or all of our forward-looking statements may prove to be inaccurate, and we can make no guarantees about our future performance.\\xa0 Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could materially differ from past results and/or those anticipated, estimated or projected.We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You should, however, consult any subsequent disclosures we make in our filings with the SEC on Form  10-Q or Form\\xa08-K.\\xa0The following is a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following are some of the important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make our actual results differ materially from those described in any forward-looking statements. It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.MACROECONOMIC RISKS Our business and the industries we serve are highly sensitive to global and regional economic conditions.\\xa0Our results of operations are materially affected by economic conditions globally and regionally and in the particular industries we serve.\\xa0 The demand for our products and services tends to be cyclical and can be significantly reduced in periods of economic weakness characterized by lower levels of government and business investment, lower levels of business confidence, lower corporate earnings, high real interest rates, lower credit activity or tighter credit conditions, perceived or actual industry overcapacity, higher unemployment and lower consumer spending. A prolonged period of economic weakness may also result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges.\\xa0 Economic conditions vary across regions and countries, and demand for our products and services generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment.\\xa0 Slower economic growth or a change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\\xa0The energy, transportation and mining industries are major users of our products, including the coal, iron ore, gold, copper, oil and natural gas industries.\\xa0 Customers in these industries frequently base their decisions to purchase our products and services on the expected future performance of these industries, which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices. Prices of commodities in these industries are frequently volatile and can change abruptly and unpredictably in response to general economic conditions and trends, government actions, regulatory actions, commodity inventories, production and consumption levels, technological innovations, commodity substitutions, market expectations and any disruptions in production or distribution or changes in consumption.\\xa0 Economic conditions affecting the industries we serve may in the future also lead to reduced capital expenditures by our customers. Reduced capital expenditures by our customers are likely to lead to a decrease in the demand for our products and services and may also result in a decrease in demand for aftermarket parts as customers are likely to extend preventative maintenance schedules and delay major overhauls when possible.\\xa0The rates of infrastructure spending, commercial construction and housing starts also play a significant role in our results.\\xa0 Our products are an integral component of these activities, and as these activities decrease, demand for our products may be significantly impacted, which could negatively impact our results.\\xa0\\xa0Commodity price changes, material price increases, fluctuations in demand for our products, significant disruptions to our supply chains or significant shortages of material may adversely impact our financial results or our ability to meet commitments to customers.\\xa0We are a significant user of steel and many other commodities required for the manufacture of our products. Increases in the prices of such commodities would increase our costs, negatively impacting our business, results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs through price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs.\\xa09Table of ContentsWe rely on suppliers to produce or secure material required for the manufacture of our products. Production challenges at suppliers, a disruption in deliveries to or from suppliers or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs.\\xa0 On the other hand, in circumstances where demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience excess inventories and be forced to incur additional costs and our profitability may suffer. Our business, competitive position, results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations, if we experience excess inventories or if we are unable to adjust our production schedules or our purchases from suppliers to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations on a timely basis. Changes in government monetary or fiscal policies may negatively impact our results.\\xa0Most countries where our products and services are sold have established central banks to regulate monetary systems and influence economic activities, generally by adjusting interest rates. Interest rate changes affect overall economic growth, which affects demand for residential and nonresidential structures, as well as energy and mined products, which in turn affects sales of our products and services that support these activities.\\xa0 Interest rate changes may also affect our customers’ ability to finance machine purchases, can change the optimal time to keep machines in a fleet and can impact the ability of our suppliers to finance the production of parts and components necessary to manufacture and support our products.\\xa0Increases in interest rates could negatively impact sales and create supply chain inefficiencies. \\xa0Central banks and other policy arms of many countries may take actions to vary the amount of liquidity and credit available in an economy. The impact from a change in liquidity and credit policies could negatively affect the customers and markets we serve or our suppliers, create supply chain inefficiencies and could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.Changes in monetary and fiscal policies, along with other factors, may cause currency exchange rates to fluctuate. Actions that lead the currency exchange rate of a country where we manufacture products to increase relative to other currencies could reduce the competitiveness of products made in that country, which could adversely affect our competitive position, results of operations and financial condition.Government policies on taxes and spending also affect our business.\\xa0 Throughout the world, government spending finances a significant portion of infrastructure development, such as highways, rail systems, airports, sewer and water systems, waterways and dams.\\xa0 Tax regulations determine asset depreciation lives and impact the after-tax returns on business activity and investment, both of which influence investment decisions.\\xa0 Unfavorable developments, such as decisions to reduce public spending or to increase taxes, could negatively impact our results.Our global operations are exposed to political and economic risks, commercial instability and events beyond our control in the countries in which we operate.\\xa0Our global operations are dependent upon products manufactured, purchased and sold in the U.S. and internationally, including in countries with political and economic instability or uncertainty.\\xa0 This includes, for example, the uncertainty related to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union (commonly known as “Brexit”). Some countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than others.\\xa0 Our business could be negatively impacted by adverse fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products. Operating in different regions and countries exposes us to a number of risks, including:•multiple and potentially conflicting laws, regulations and policies that are subject to change;•imposition of currency restrictions, restrictions on repatriation of earnings or other restraints;•imposition of new or additional tariffs or quotas;•withdrawal from or modification of trade agreements or the negotiation of new trade agreements;•imposition of new or additional trade and economic sanctions laws imposed by the U.S. or foreign governments;•war or acts of terrorism; and•political and economic instability or civil unrest that may severely disrupt economic activity in affected countries.10Table of ContentsThe occurrence of one or more of these events may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\\xa0OPERATIONAL RISKSThe success of our business depends on our ability to develop, produce and market quality products that meet our customers’ needs.\\xa0Our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products.\\xa0 To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to our dealers, OEMs and end-user customers.\\xa0 This is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to maintain key dealer relationships, our ability to produce products that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers and our ability to develop effective sales, advertising and marketing programs.\\xa0 In addition, our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on leading-edge innovation, with respect to both products and operations, and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovations.\\xa0 Failure to continue to deliver high quality, innovative, competitive products to the marketplace, to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements, including engine exhaust emission requirements or to predict market demands for, or gain market acceptance of, our products, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We operate in a highly competitive environment, which could adversely affect our sales and pricing.\\xa0We operate in a highly competitive environment.\\xa0 We compete on the basis of a variety of factors, including product performance, customer service, quality and price.\\xa0 There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies’ products.\\xa0 Thus, our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties, our failure to price our products competitively, our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or an unexpected buildup in competitors’ new machine or dealer-owned rental fleets, which could lead to downward pressure on machine rental rates and/or used equipment prices.\\xa0Lack of customer acceptance of price increases we announce from time to time, changes in customer requirements for price discounts, changes in our customers’ behavior or a weak pricing environment could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\\xa0In addition, our results and ability to compete may be impacted negatively by changes in our geographic and product mix of sales.\\xa0\\xa0Increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services.We rely upon information technology systems and networks, some of which are managed by third parties, in connection with a variety of business activities. Additionally, we collect and store sensitive information relating to our business, customers, dealers, suppliers and employees.  Operating these information technology systems and networks and processing and maintaining this data in a secure manner, is critical to our business operations and strategy.  Information technology security threats -- from user error to cybersecurity attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems, networks and data -- are increasing in frequency and sophistication.  Cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Cybersecurity attacks could also include attacks targeting customer data or the security, integrity and/or reliability of the hardware and software installed in our products.  It is possible that our information technology systems and networks, or those managed by third parties, could have vulnerabilities, which could go unnoticed for a period of time. While various procedures and controls have been and are being utilized to mitigate such risks, there can be no guarantee that the actions and controls we have implemented and are implementing, or which we cause or have caused third party service providers to implement, will be sufficient to protect our systems, information or other property. 11Table of ContentsWe have experienced cyber security threats and vulnerabilities in our systems and those of our third party providers, and we have experienced viruses and attacks targeting our information technology systems and networks. Such prior events, to date, have not had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, the potential consequences of a future material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, government enforcement actions, penalties, disruption to systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, corruption of data, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness, results of operations and financial condition. Due to the evolving nature of such security threats, the potential impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. Further, the amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities relating to a cybersecurity attack. In addition, data we collect, store and process is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, such as the European Union\\'s General Data Protection Regulation that became effective in May 2018, which may carry significant potential penalties for noncompliance. Our business is subject to the inventory management decisions and sourcing practices of our dealers and our OEM customers.\\xa0We sell finished products primarily through an independent dealer network and directly to OEMs and are subject to risks relating to their inventory management decisions and operational and sourcing practices.\\xa0 Both carry inventories of finished products as part of ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs and market conditions, including levels of used equipment inventory and machine rental usage rates.\\xa0 Such adjustments may impact our results positively or negatively.\\xa0 If the inventory levels of our dealers and OEM customers are higher than they desire, they may postpone product purchases from us, which could cause our sales to be lower than the end-user demand for our products and negatively impact our results. Similarly, our results could be negatively impacted through the loss of time-sensitive sales if our dealers and OEM customers do not maintain inventory levels sufficient to meet customer demand. We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, joint ventures or divestitures, or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected.In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures. We often compete with others for the same opportunities. To be successful, we conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies, negotiate transaction terms, complete complex transactions and manage post-closing matters such as the integration of acquired businesses. Further, while we seek to mitigate risks and liabilities of such transactions through due diligence, among other things, there may be risks and liabilities that our due diligence efforts fail to discover, that are not accurately or completely disclosed to us or that we inadequately assess.  We may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following a completed acquisition, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities. Risks associated with our past or future acquisitions also include the following:•the failure to achieve the acquisition\\'s revenue or profit forecast; •the business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture;•technological and product synergies, economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected;•unforeseen expenses, delays or conditions may be imposed upon the acquisition, including due to required regulatory approvals or consents;•we may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities or be subject to unexpected penalties or other enforcement actions;•faulty assumptions may be made regarding the macroeconomic environment or the integration process;•unforeseen difficulties may arise in integrating operations, processes and systems;•higher than expected investments may be required to implement necessary compliance processes and related systems, including information technology systems, accounting systems and internal controls over financial reporting;•we may fail to retain, motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business;•higher than expected costs may arise due to unforeseen changes in tax, trade, environmental, labor, safety, payroll or pension policies in any jurisdiction in which the acquired business conducts its operations; and12Table of Contents•we may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases.Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and attention. They may also delay the realization of the benefits we anticipate when we enter into a transaction. \\xa0In order to conserve cash for operations, we may undertake acquisitions financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, or other arrangements.\\xa0 Such acquisition financing could result in a decrease in our earnings and adversely affect other leverage measures.\\xa0 If we issue equity securities or equity-linked securities, the issued securities may have a dilutive effect on the interests of the holders of our common shares.\\xa0Failure to implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\\xa0 Furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. In the case of divestitures, we may agree to indemnify acquiring parties for certain liabilities arising from our former businesses. These divestitures may also result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses following the transaction, including through guarantees or other financial arrangements.\\xa0 Lower performance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results.Union disputes or other labor matters could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\\xa0Some of our employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates.\\xa0 There can be no assurance that any current or future issues with our employees will be resolved or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages or other disputes with labor unions or our employees.\\xa0 We may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the United States and other countries when they expire.\\xa0 If we fail to renegotiate our existing collective bargaining agreements, we could encounter strikes or work stoppages or other disputes with labor unions.\\xa0 In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at our facilities in the future.\\xa0 We may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements. A work stoppage or other limitations on production at our facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces. Strikes or work stoppages experienced by our customers or suppliers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Unexpected events may increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations.\\xa0The occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including war, acts of terrorism or violence, civil unrest, fires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other forms of severe weather in the United States or in other countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\\xa0 Natural disasters, pandemic illness, including the current COVID-19 outbreak, equipment failures, power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers, and disruption and delay in the transport of our products to dealers, end-users and distribution centers.\\xa0 Existing insurance coverage may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events.FINANCIAL RISKSDisruptions or volatility in global financial markets could limit our sources of liquidity, or the liquidity of our customers, dealers and suppliers.\\xa0Continuing to meet our cash requirements over the long-term requires substantial liquidity and access to varied sources of funds, including capital and credit markets. Global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. Market volatility, changes in counterparty credit risk, the impact of government intervention in financial markets and general economic conditions may also adversely impact our ability to access capital and credit markets to fund operating needs.\\xa0 Global or regional economic downturns could cause financial markets to decrease the availability of liquidity, credit and credit capacity for certain issuers, including certain customers, dealers and suppliers. An inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.  Furthermore, changes in global economic conditions, including material cost increases and decreases in economic activity in key markets we serve, and the success of plans to manage cost increases, inventory and other important elements of our business may significantly impact our ability to generate funds from operations.\\xa013Table of Contents\\xa0In addition, demand for our products generally depends on customers’ ability to pay for our products, which, in turn, depends on their access to funds. Changes in global economic conditions may result in customers experiencing increased difficulty in generating funds from operations. Capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty may cause financial institutions to revise their lending standards, resulting in customers’ decreased access to capital. If capital and credit market volatility occurs, customers’ liquidity may decline which, in turn, would reduce their ability to purchase our products.Failure to maintain our credit ratings would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets.\\xa0Each of Caterpillar’s and Cat Financial’s costs of borrowing and their respective ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short- and long-term credit ratings assigned to their respective debt by the major credit rating agencies.\\xa0 These ratings are based, in significant part, on each of Caterpillar’s and Cat Financial’s performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth, interest coverage and leverage ratios, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting.\\xa0 There can be no assurance that Caterpillar and Cat Financial will be able to maintain their credit ratings.  We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies.\\xa0 Moody’s long- and short-term ratings of Caterpillar and Cat Financial are A3 and Prime-2 (“low-A”), while other major credit rating agencies maintain a “mid-A” debt rating.  A downgrade of our credit rating by any of the major credit rating agencies would result in increased borrowing costs and could adversely affect Caterpillar’s and Cat Financial’s liquidity, competitive position and access to the capital markets, including restricting, in whole or in part, access to the commercial paper market.\\xa0 There can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of short-term financing for Cat Financial or an available source of short-term financing for Caterpillar. An inability to access the capital markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\\xa0Our Financial Products segment is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry.\\xa0Cat Financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support for a significant share of our global sales. The inability of Cat Financial to access funds to support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Continuing to meet Cat Financial\\'s cash requirements over the long-term could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds, including capital and credit markets. Cat Financial has continued to maintain access to key global medium term note and commercial paper markets, but there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing. If global economic conditions were to deteriorate, Cat Financial could face materially higher financing costs, become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business and/or meet its debt service obligations as they mature, and be required to draw upon contractually committed lending agreements and/or seek other funding sources. However, there can be no assurance that such agreements and other funding sources would be available or sufficient under extreme market conditions.\\xa0 Any of these events could negatively impact Cat Financial’s business, as well as our and Cat Financial\\'s results of operations and financial condition. \\xa0Market disruption and volatility may also lead to a number of other risks in connection with these events, including but not limited to:•Market developments that may affect customer confidence levels and cause declines in the demand for financing and adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could impact Cat Financial’s write-offs and provision for credit losses.•The process Cat Financial uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires a high degree of management’s judgment regarding numerous subjective qualitative factors, including forecasts of economic conditions and how economic predictors might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans.\\xa0 Financial market disruption and volatility may impact the accuracy of these judgments.•Cat Financial’s ability to engage in routine funding transactions or borrow from other financial institutions on acceptable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations.•As Cat Financial’s lending agreements are primarily with financial institutions, their ability to perform in accordance with any of its underlying agreements could be adversely affected by market volatility and/or disruptions in financial markets.14Table of ContentsChanges in interest rates or market liquidity conditions could adversely affect Cat Financial\\'s and our earnings and/or cash flow.Changes in interest rates and market liquidity conditions could have an adverse impact on Cat Financial\\'s and our earnings and cash flows. Because a significant number of the loans made by Cat Financial are made at fixed interest rates, its business results are subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Certain loans made by Cat Financial and various financing extended to Cat Financial are made at variable rates that use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate.\\xa0 LIBOR is the subject of recent proposals for reform.\\xa0 On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021.\\xa0 These reforms may cause LIBOR to cease to exist, new methods of calculating LIBOR to be established such that LIBOR continues to exist after 2021 or the establishment of an alternative reference rate(s).\\xa0 Several offerings of securities that include such an alternative reference rate have now been completed by other companies. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of LIBOR-linked securities, loans, derivatives, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to Cat Financial, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those securities, loans and financial instruments. Cat Financial has created a cross-functional team that will assess risk across multiple categories as it relates to the use of LIBOR in securities, loans, derivatives, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us. The team is also closely monitoring the progress of LIBOR reform and preparing to incorporate appropriate fallback language for transitioning to an alternative reference rate(s) into new agreements with customers. The team is reviewing how to best manage those customer agreements that extend beyond 2021 and utilize LIBOR.\\xa0 Other changes in market interest rates may influence Cat Financial’s  borrowing costs and could reduce its and our earnings and cash flows, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts. Cat Financial manages interest rate and market liquidity risks through a variety of techniques that include a match funding strategy, the selective use of derivatives and a broadly diversified funding program. There can be no assurance, however, that fluctuations in interest rates and market liquidity conditions will not have an adverse impact on its and our earnings and cash flows. If any of the variety of instruments and strategies Cat Financial uses to hedge its exposure to these types of risk is ineffective, this may have an adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows.\\xa0 With respect to Insurance Services\\' investment activities, changes in the equity and bond markets could result in a decline in value of its investment portfolio, resulting in an unfavorable impact to earnings. An increase in delinquencies, repossessions or net losses of Cat Financial customers could adversely affect its results.\\xa0Inherent in the operation of Cat Financial is the credit risk associated with its customers. The creditworthiness of each customer and the rate of delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations are directly impacted by several factors, including relevant industry and economic conditions, the availability of capital, the experience and expertise of the customer\\'s management team, commodity prices, political events and the sustained value of the underlying collateral. Any increase in delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer obligations could have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial\\'s and our earnings and cash flows. In addition, although Cat Financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses related to past due and non-performing receivables on a regular basis, adverse economic conditions or other factors that might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers could change the timing and level of payments received and necessitate an increase in Cat Financial\\'s estimated losses, which could also have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial\\'s and our earnings and cash flows.Currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations.\\xa0We conduct operations in many countries involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies.\\xa0 We are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues.\\xa0 Fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results as expressed in U.S. dollars.\\xa0 There can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. While the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In addition, our outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates from the date of our outlooks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in our outlooks and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. \\xa0We also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.\\xa015Table of ContentsRestrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial and operating flexibility.\\xa0We maintain a number of credit facilities to support general corporate purposes (facilities) and have issued debt securities to manage liquidity and fund operations (debt securities).\\xa0 The agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us and certain subsidiaries, including Cat Financial.\\xa0 These covenants include maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth (defined as the consolidated shareholder’s equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other post-retirement benefits balance within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)), limitations on the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation and merger. Cat Financial has also agreed under certain of these agreements not to exceed a certain leverage ratio (consolidated debt to consolidated net worth, calculated (1)\\xa0on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2)\\xa0at each December\\xa031), to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio (profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to interest expense, calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended) and not to terminate, amend or modify its support agreement with us.\\xa0A breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse consequences that could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. These consequences may include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the facilities, triggering of an obligation to redeem certain debt securities, termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders, refusal by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the facilities or to enter into new facilities or the lowering or modification of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries.\\xa0Sustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans may impair our liquidity or financial condition.\\xa0We maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our employees, which impose on us certain funding obligations. In determining our future payment obligations under the plans, we assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and a certain level of future benefit payments.  Significant adverse changes in credit or capital markets could result in actual rates of return being materially lower than projected and result in increased contribution requirements.\\xa0 Our assumptions for future benefit payments may also change over time and could be materially higher than originally projected. We expect to make contributions to our pension plans in the future, and may be required to make contributions that could be material.\\xa0 We may fund contributions through the use of cash on hand, the proceeds of borrowings, shares of our common stock or a combination of the foregoing, as permitted by applicable law.  Our assumptions for future benefit payments may change over time and could be materially higher than projected.\\xa0 These factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans, and as a result, adversely affect our business and overall financial condition.LEGAL & REGULATORY RISKSOur global operations are subject to a wide-range of trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations.\\xa0Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Antiboycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries.\\xa0 Any alleged or actual violations may subject us to increased government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States.\\xa0 Furthermore, embargoes and sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales to specific persons or countries or based on product classification may expose us to potential criminal and civil sanctions. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or in certain locations the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\\xa0In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws.\\xa0 Our operations outside the United States, including in developing countries, expose us to the the risk of such violations.  Violations of anti-corruption laws or regulations by our employees, intermediaries acting on our behalf, or our joint venture partners may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.16Table of ContentsInternational trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position.\\xa0Government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, capital controls or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries.\\xa0 The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, in countries where we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\\xa0 For example, a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations.We may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure.\\xa0We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings between U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions or among jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax laws or treaties or in their application or interpretation, changes in tax rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures. We are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. For information regarding additional legal matters related to our taxes, please see Note 6 — “Income taxes” and Note 22 — “Environmental and legal matters” of Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Costs associated with lawsuits or investigations or adverse rulings in enforcement or other legal proceedings may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\\xa0We are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks in virtually every part of the world. We face risk of exposure to various types of claims, lawsuits and government investigations. We are involved in various claims and lawsuits related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed asbestos exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters, intellectual property rights, tax, securities and other legal proceedings that arise in and outside of the ordinary course of our business.\\xa0 The industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims.\\xa0 It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims, investigations and lawsuits, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations or financial condition in any particular period.\\xa0The global and diverse nature of our operations means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time. In addition, subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.New regulations or changes in financial services regulation could adversely impact Caterpillar and Cat Financial.\\xa0Cat Financial’s operations are highly regulated by governmental authorities in the locations where it operates, which can impose significant additional costs and/or restrictions on its business. In the United States, for example, certain Cat Financial activities are subject to the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), which includes extensive provisions regulating the financial services industry. As a result, Cat Financial has become and could continue to become subject to additional regulatory costs that could be significant and have an adverse effect on Cat Financial’s and our results of operations and financial condition. Changes in regulations or additional regulations in the United States or internationally impacting the financial services industry could also add significant cost or operational constraints that might have an adverse effect on Cat Financial’s and our results of operations and financial condition. 17Table of ContentsWe are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs.\\xa0Our facilities, operations and products are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations globally, including laws and regulations governing emissions to noise, air, releases to soil and discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous waste materials. Some environmental laws impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances, even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred, or for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators, predecessors or other third parties. Failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or clean-up costs, civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities, as well as damage to property or natural resources. The potential liabilities, sanctions, damages and remediation efforts related to any non-compliance with such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there can be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future.Environmental laws and regulations may change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. Changes in environmental laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. Changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs. If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, they could negatively impact our reputation, business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.Item 1B.Unresolved Staff Comments.\\xa0None.\\xa018Table of ContentsItem 1C.Executive Officers of the Registrant.Name and age\\xa0Present\\xa0Caterpillar\\xa0Inc.\\xa0position and\\xa0date\\xa0of initial\\xa0election\\xa0Principal\\xa0positions\\xa0held\\xa0during\\xa0thepast\\xa0five\\xa0years\\xa0if\\xa0other\\xa0thanCaterpillar\\xa0Inc.\\xa0position\\xa0currently\\xa0heldD.

Risk Factors of the 2019 Form\\xa010-K.OVERVIEWOur sales and revenues for 2019 were $53.800 billion, a 2 percent decrease from 2018 sales and revenues of $54.722 billion. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume. The sales volume decline was mostly due to changes in dealer inventories, partially offset by higher end-user demand. Sales were lower in EAME and Asia/Pacific, while North America and Latin America were about flat. Sales declined in Energy & Transportation and Construction Industries, while Resource Industries was about flat. Profit per share for 2019 was $10.74, compared to profit per share of $10.26 in 2018. Profit was $6.093 billion in 2019, compared with $6.147 billion in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to higher tax expense as operating profit was about flat. Operating profit was about flat as favorable price realization, lower selling, general and administrative (SG&A) and research and development (R&D) expenses and higher Financial Products’ profit were offset by higher manufacturing costs, lower sales volume and unfavorable currency impacts.Fourth-quarter 2019 sales and revenues were $13.144 billion, down $1.198 billion, or 8 percent, from $14.342 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. Fourth-quarter 2019 profit was $1.97 per share, compared with $1.78 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018. Fourth-quarter 2019 profit was $1.098 billion, compared with $1.048 billion in 2018.Highlights for 2019 include:•Sales and revenues in 2019 were $53.800 billion, down 2 percent from 2018. Sales declined in Energy & Transportation and Construction Industries, while Resource Industries was about flat.•Operating profit as a percent of sales and revenues was 15.4 percent in 2019, compared with 15.2 percent in 2018.•Profit was $10.74 per share for 2019, and excluding the items in the table below, adjusted profit per share was $11.06.

Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company’s Board of Directors and employees.Total sales and revenues were $53.800 billion in 2019, a decrease of $922 million, or 2 percent, compared with $54.722 billion in 2018. The decrease was mostly due to lower sales volume driven by changes in dealer inventories, partially offset by higher end-user demand. Unfavorable currency impacts, primarily from a weaker euro, Australian dollar, Chinese yuan and Brazilian real, were mostly offset by favorable price realization. Sales decreased in Energy & Transportation and Construction Industries, while Resource Industries was about flat. Sales decreased in EAME and Asia/Pacific, while North America and Latin America were about flat.North America sales were about flat compared with prior year as favorable price realization was mostly offset by lower sales volume.  Sales volume declined primarily due to changes in dealer inventories as dealers increased inventories more during 2018 than 2019, partially offset by higher end-user demand.Sales were about flat in Latin America as higher sales volume was offset by an unfavorable currency impact from a weaker Brazilian real. Sales volume increased due to higher end-user demand which was mostly offset by changes in dealer inventories as dealers increased inventories more during 2018 than 2019.EAME sales decreased 6 percent primarily due to lower sales volume and the unfavorable impact of a weaker euro, partially offset by higher price realization. The decrease in sales volume was primarily due to changes in dealer inventories. Dealers increased inventories during 2018 and decreased inventories during 2019. Asia/Pacific sales declined 4 percent primarily due to unfavorable currency impacts of a weaker Australian dollar and Chinese yuan and lower sales volume. Sales volume decreased due to changes in dealer inventories, partially offset by higher end-user demand. Dealer inventories increased more during 2018 than 2019. Dealer machine and engine inventories increased about $2.3 billion in 2018, compared with an increase of about $800 million in 2019. Dealers are independent, and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers’ demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers. We expect dealer inventories to decline about $1.0 to $1.5 billion during 2020.27Table of ContentsSales and Revenues by

reasons for the change in consolidated operating profit between 2018 (at left) and 2019 (at right). Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company’s Board of Directors and employees. The bar entitled Other includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy & Transportation other operating (income) expenses.Operating profit was $8.290 billion in 2019, about flat with $8.293 billion in 2018. Favorable price realization mostly offset higher manufacturing costs. Lower sales volume offset favorable selling, general and administrative (SG&A) and research and development (R&D) expenses and higher profit from Financial Products.Manufacturing costs increased due to higher warranty expense, increased variable labor and burden, unfavorable cost absorption, and higher material costs. Cost absorption was unfavorable as inventory increased during 2018, compared with a decrease during 2019. The increase was partially offset by lower period manufacturing costs driven by lower short-term incentive compensation expense and the favorable impact of restructuring and cost-reduction actions.SG&A/R&D expenses decreased due to lower short-term incentive compensation expense, partially offset by investments aligned with the company’s strategic growth initiatives.Short-term incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance, measured against targets set annually. Short-term incentive compensation expense in 2018 was about $1.4 billion, compared with about $700 million in 2019. For 2020, we expect short-term incentive compensation expense will be about $800 million.

The decrease was due to a lower expected return on pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plan assets more than offset by lower foreign exchange losses, unrealized and realized gains on marketable securities at Insurance Services and the favorable impact of commodity hedges.•The provision for income taxes for 2019 reflected an annual effective tax rate of 25.2 percent, compared with 24.1 percent for 2018, excluding the discrete items discussed in the following paragraph. The increase from 2018 was largely driven by the application of U.S. tax reform provisions to the earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which do not have a calendar fiscal year-end.  These provisions did not apply to these subsidiaries in 2018. The provision for income taxes also included the following:◦A tax benefit of $178 million to adjust previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of receipt of additional guidance in 2019 related to the calculation of the mandatory deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings due to U.S. tax reform.  In 2018, the mandatory deemed repatriation estimate increased by $50 million.◦A tax benefit of $41 million in 2019, compared with $56 million in 2018, for the settlement of stock-based compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP compensation expense.◦A net benefit of $183 million in 2018 to adjust deferred tax balances.  (See Note – 6 “Income Taxes” of Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for more information.)Construction IndustriesConstruction Industries’ total sales were $22.649 billion for 2019, a decrease of $588 million, or 3 percent, compared with $23.237 billion for 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume driven by changes in dealer inventories, partially offset by higher end-user demand. Dealer inventories increased significantly more during 2018 than during 2019. Favorable price realization was offset by unfavorable currency impacts from a weaker euro, Chinese yuan and Australian dollar.  Sales increased in North America and Latin America, and decreased in Asia/Pacific and EAME. •In North America, the sales increase was primarily due to higher demand for construction equipment and favorable price realization.•Sales were higher in Latin America. While construction activities remained at low levels, the increase was driven by road and non-residential construction activities.•Sales decreased in EAME primarily due to changes in dealer inventories and the unfavorable impact of a weaker euro, partially offset by favorable price realization. Dealer inventories increased during 2018, compared with a decrease during 2019.30Table of Contents•Sales in Asia/Pacific decreased mostly due to lower demand, including changes in dealer inventories, and unfavorable currency impacts. The unfavorable currency impacts were due to a weaker Chinese yuan and Australian dollar. Dealers increased inventories during 2018 and decreased inventories during 2019. The lower demand was primarily in China due to continued competitive pressures. In addition, demand was lower across the region.Construction Industries’ profit was $3.931 billion in 2019, a decrease of $243 million, or 6 percent, compared with $4.174 billion in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume, including an unfavorable mix of products, and higher manufacturing costs, which were partially offset by favorable price realization and lower SG&A/R&D expenses. Manufacturing costs increased primarily due to unfavorable variable labor and burden. Lower SG&A/R&D expenses were due to lower short-term incentive compensation expense, partially offset by investments aligned with the company’s strategic growth initiatives.Construction Industries’ profit as a percent of total sales was 17.4 percent in 2019, compared with 18.0 percent in 2018.Resource IndustriesResource Industries’ total sales were $10.276 billion in 2019, about flat with $10.270 billion in 2018. Higher end-user demand for equipment and favorable price realization were offset by changes in dealer inventories and unfavorable currency impacts, primarily the weaker Australian dollar and euro. Higher end-user demand was driven by increased capital investment by mining customers to support ongoing mine site operations. End-user demand also increased for our non-residential construction and quarry and aggregate customers. Dealers increased inventories more significantly during 2018 than during 2019. Resource Industries’ profit was $1.629 billion in 2019, an increase of $26 million, or 2 percent, compared with $1.603 billion in  2018. The improvement was mostly due to favorable price realization, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs. Manufacturing costs increased due to higher warranty expense, unfavorable cost absorption, increased variable labor and burden and higher material costs, partially offset by the favorable period manufacturing costs due to the impact of restructuring and cost-reduction actions and lower short-term incentive compensation expense. Cost absorption was unfavorable as inventory increased more during 2018 than 2019.Resource Industries’ profit as a percent of total sales was 15.9 percent in 2019, compared with 15.6 percent in 2018.Energy & TransportationSales by Application\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(Millions of dollars)\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa0$Change\\xa0%\\xa0ChangeOil and Gas\\xa0$5,205\\xa0$5,763\\xa0$(558)\\xa0(10%)Power Generation\\xa04,474\\xa04,334\\xa0140\\xa03%Industrial\\xa03,749\\xa03,640\\xa0109\\xa03%Transportation\\xa05,057\\xa05,095\\xa0(38)\\xa0(1%)External Sales\\xa018,485\\xa018,832\\xa0(347)\\xa0(2%)Inter-Segment\\xa03,612\\xa03,953\\xa0(341)\\xa0(9%)Total Sales\\xa0$22,097\\xa0$22,785\\xa0$(688)\\xa0(3%)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Energy & Transportation’s total sales were $22.097 billion in 2019, compared with $22.785 billion in 2018.  Sales declined primarily due to lower inter-segment engine sales and unfavorable currency impacts, primarily from the weaker euro and Australian dollar. ▪Oil and Gas – Sales decreased in North America primarily due to lower new equipment demand for well servicing and the timing of turbine project deliveries for gas compression and production. Lower sales in North America were partially offset by increases in all other regions, primarily Asia/Pacific.▪Power Generation – Sales increased mostly due to higher deliveries of diesel reciprocating engines in North America and higher turbine sales across all regions. The increase was partially offset by lower diesel reciprocating engine sales in EAME and Asia/Pacific driven by unfavorable currency impacts and lower volume.▪Industrial – Sales improved primarily in North America and Asia/Pacific driven by higher end-user demand.▪Transportation – Sales were about flat as lower locomotive sales were offset by stronger marine demand.Energy & Transportation’s profit was $3.910 billion for 2019, a decrease of $28 million, or 1 percent, compared with $3.938 billion for 2018. The decrease was mostly due to lower sales volumes, partially offset by lower SG&A/R&D expenses. Lower SG&A/R&D expenses were primarily due to lower short-term incentive compensation expense. Higher manufacturing costs were more than offset by favorable price realization and favorable other operating (income) expenses. 31Table of ContentsEnergy & Transportation’s profit as a percent of total sales was 17.7 percent in 2019, compared with 17.3 percent in 2018.Financial Products SegmentFinancial Products’ segment revenues were $3.434 billion, an increase of $155 million, or 5 percent, from 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher average financing rates in North America and Asia/Pacific, an increase in earned premiums from Insurance Services across all regions and higher average earning assets in North America.  These favorable impacts were partially offset by the absence of fees associated with an intercompany credit facility in North America.Financial Products’ segment profit was $832 million in 2019, compared with $505 million in 2018. Most of the increase was due to lower provision for credit losses at Cat Financial, driven by a lower allowance rate compared with 2018.  The lower allowance rate was due to write-offs of accounts in 2019 that were reserved for in 2018, primarily in the Cat Power Finance portfolio. In addition, there was a favorable impact from an increase in net yield on average earning assets and a favorable impact from equity securities in Insurance Services. These favorable impacts were partially offset by higher SG&A expenses and the absence of the intercompany credit facility.At the end of 2019, past dues at Cat Financial were 3.14 percent, compared with 3.55 percent at the end 2018. Write-offs, net of recoveries, were $237 million for 2019, an increase from $189 million for 2018, primarily due to Mining, Caterpillar Power Finance and EAME, partially offset by a decrease in Latin America.  The increase in Mining was due to a small number of customer balances written off in 2019, while the increases in Caterpillar Power Finance and EAME were concentrated in the marine portfolio and the Middle East, respectively.  As of December 31, 2019, Cat Financial’s allowance for credit losses totaled $424 million, or 1.50 percent of finance receivables, compared with $511 million, or 1.80 percent of finance receivables, at December 31, 2018.Corporate Items and EliminationsExpense for corporate items and eliminations was $1.585 billion in 2019, an increase of $19 million from 2018. The increase was primarily due to methodology differences, mostly offset by lower restructuring costs and timing differences.32Table of ContentsFOURTH QUARTER 2019 COMPARED WITH FOURTH QUARTER 2018 CONSOLIDATED SALES AND REVENUESThe chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated sales and revenues between the fourth quarter of 2018 (at left) and the fourth quarter of 2019 (at right). Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company’s Board of Directors and employees.Total sales and revenues of $13.144 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019 decreased $1.198 billion, or 8 percent, compared with $14.342 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. The decline was due to lower sales volume driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories and lower end-user demand, primarily in Construction Industries and Resource Industries. Dealers decreased machine and engine inventories about $700 million during the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with an increase of about $200 million during the fourth quarter of 2018. The largest sales decrease was in North America, which declined 14 percent due to lower demand, including changes in dealer inventories. Dealer inventories increased during the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with a decrease during the fourth quarter of 2019.Sales decreased 16 percent in Latin America due to lower demand across the region.EAME sales decreased 6 percent primarily due to changes in dealer inventories and unfavorable currency impacts, primarily from the weaker euro. Dealer inventories decreased more during the fourth quarter of 2019 than the fourth quarter of 2018.Asia/Pacific sales were about flat as higher sales volume was offset by unfavorable price realization and currency impacts, primarily from the weaker Australian dollar. Sales volume was higher as improved end-user demand was partially offset by changes in dealer inventories. Dealer inventories increased more during the fourth quarter of 2018 than the fourth quarter of 2019.Dealers decreased machine and engine inventories about $700 million during the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with an increase of about $200 million during the fourth quarter of 2018. Dealers are independent, and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers’ demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers.33Table of ContentsSales and Revenues by

chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated operating profit between the fourth quarter of 2018 (at left) and the fourth quarter of 2019 (at right). Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company’s Board of Directors and employees. The bar entitled Other includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy & Transportation other operating (income) expenses.Operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $1.850 billion, a decrease of $33 million, or 2 percent, compared with $1.883 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume, mostly offset by lower SG&A and R&D expenses and higher profit from Financial Products. Lower SG&A/R&D expenses were mostly due to a reduction in short-term incentive compensation expense and timing of R&D expenses.Financial Products’ operating profit was higher, primarily due to lower provisions for credit losses related to the Cat Power Finance portfolio compared with the fourth quarter of 2018. In addition, favorable manufacturing costs were mostly offset by unfavorable price realization. Manufacturing costs decreased primarily due to lower period manufacturing and material costs, partially offset by higher warranty expense. Period manufacturing costs declined mainly due to lower short-term incentive compensation and the favorable impact of restructuring and cost-reduction actions.Short-term incentive compensation expense was about $120 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with about $310 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.Operating profit margin in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 14.1 percent, compared with 13.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018.35Table of ContentsProfit (Loss) by Segment\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(Millions\\xa0of\\xa0dollars)\\xa0Fourth Quarter 2019\\xa0Fourth Quarter 2018\\xa0$Change\\xa0%ChangeConstruction Industries\\xa0$659\\xa0$845\\xa0$(186)\\xa0(22%)Resource Industries\\xa0261\\xa0400\\xa0(139)\\xa0(35%)Energy & Transportation \\xa01,165\\xa01,079\\xa086\\xa08%All Other Segment\\xa0(11)\\xa0(47)\\xa036\\xa077%Corporate Items and Eliminations\\xa0(325)\\xa0(375)\\xa050\\xa0\\xa0Machinery, Energy & Transportation\\xa01,749\\xa01,902\\xa0(153)\\xa0(8%)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Financial Products Segment\\xa0210\\xa029\\xa0181\\xa0624%Corporate Items and Eliminations\\xa0(6)\\xa054\\xa0(60)\\xa0\\xa0Financial Products\\xa0204\\xa083\\xa0121\\xa0146%Consolidating Adjustments\\xa0(103)\\xa0(102)\\xa0(1)\\xa0\\xa0Consolidated Operating Profit\\xa0$1,850\\xa0$1,883\\xa0$(33)\\xa0(2%)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Other Profit/Loss and Tax Items •Interest expense excluding Financial Products in the fourth quarter of 2019 was $112 million, compared with $99 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase was due to higher average debt outstanding during the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with the fourth quarter of 2018.•Other income (expense) in the fourth quarter of 2019 was expense of $373 million, compared with expense of $417 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. The decrease in expense was due to the favorable impact of commodity hedges, higher realized gains and lower unrealized losses on marketable securities at Insurance Services, which were partially offset by unfavorable pension and OPEB costs.•The provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter reflected an annual effective tax rate of 25.2 percent, compared with 24.1 percent for the full year of 2018, excluding discrete items discussed in the following paragraph. The increase from 2018 was largely driven by the application of U.S. tax reform provisions to the earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which do not have a calendar fiscal year-end. These provisions did not apply to these subsidiaries in 2018. The provision for income taxes also included the following:◦The change from the third-quarter estimated annual tax rate of 26 percent to the annual effective tax rate of 25.2 percent resulted in a $54 million tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2019. ◦A tax benefit of $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, for the settlement of stock-based compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP compensation expense. ◦A net tax benefit of $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 for other discrete items.Construction IndustriesConstruction Industries’ total sales were $5.020 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019, a decrease of $685 million, or 12 percent, compared with $5.705 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. The decrease was due to lower sales volume, driven mostly by the impact from changes in dealer inventories. Dealers decreased inventories during the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with dealer inventories that were about flat during the fourth quarter of 2018. Unfavorable price realization also contributed to the decline in sales.•In North America, sales decreased due to lower demand driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories, while end-user demand was about flat. Dealers decreased inventories during the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with an increase during the fourth quarter of 2018.•Sales were higher in Latin America. While construction activities remained at low levels, the increase was driven by road and residential construction activities.•In EAME, the sales decrease was primarily due to the impact from changes in dealer inventories and lower end-user demand across most of the region. Dealers decreased inventories more during the fourth quarter of 2019 than during the fourth quarter of 2018.36Table of Contents•Sales in Asia/Pacific were about flat as unfavorable price realization was mostly offset by a few countries’ higher sales volume.Construction Industries’ profit was $659 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, a decrease of $186 million, or 22 percent, compared with $845 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume.In addition, favorable manufacturing costs were mostly offset by unfavorable price realization. Manufacturing costs decreased due to lower period manufacturing and material costs. Period manufacturing costs declined mainly due to the favorable impact of restructuring and cost-reduction actions as well as lower short-term incentive compensation.Construction Industries’ profit as a percent of total sales was 13.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with 14.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018.Resource IndustriesResource Industries’ total sales were $2.395 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019, a decrease of $402 million, or 14 percent, compared with $2.797 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. The decrease was due to lower sales volume, driven by changes in dealer inventories and lower end-user demand. Dealers increased inventories during the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with a decrease during the fourth quarter of 2019. While commodity prices are generally supportive of reinvestment, the company continues to believe mining customers remained disciplined in their capital expenditures due to economic uncertainty, resulting in lower sales in the quarter. In addition, end-user demand decreased for equipment supporting non-residential construction.Resource Industries’ profit was $261 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, a decrease of $139 million, or 35 percent, compared with $400 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. The decrease was mainly due to lower sales volume, partially offset by lower SG&A/R&D expenses and favorable price realization. The decrease in SG&A/R&D expenses reflected a reduction in short-term incentive compensation expense and timing of R&D expenses.Resource Industries’ profit as a percent of total sales was 10.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with 14.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018.Energy & TransportationSales by Application\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(Millions of dollars)\\xa0Fourth Quarter 2019\\xa0Fourth Quarter 2018\\xa0$Change\\xa0%\\xa0ChangeOil and Gas\\xa0$1,523\\xa0$1,719\\xa0$(196)\\xa0(11%)Power Generation\\xa01,294\\xa01,271\\xa023\\xa02%Industrial\\xa0908\\xa0902\\xa06\\xa01%Transportation\\xa01,441\\xa01,373\\xa068\\xa05%External Sales\\xa05,166\\xa05,265\\xa0(99)\\xa0(2%)Inter-Segment\\xa0783\\xa01,022\\xa0(239)\\xa0(23%)Total Sales\\xa0$5,949\\xa0$6,287\\xa0$(338)\\xa0(5%)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Energy & Transportation’s total sales were $5.949 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019, a decrease of $338 million, or 5 percent, compared with $6.287 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. Sales declined primarily due to lower inter-segment engine sales and unfavorable currency impacts.•Oil and Gas - Sales were lower mainly in North America. The sales decline was largely due to lower demand for reciprocating engines used in gas compression and lower turbine project deliveries.•Power Generation - Sales increased slightly primarily due to higher deliveries for turbines in EAME.•Industrial - Sales were about flat as slightly higher sales in North America were partially offset by lower sales in Latin America and EAME.•Transportation - Sales were higher mainly due to stronger marine demand in EAME.Energy & Transportation’s profit was $1.165 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of $86 million, or 8 percent, compared with $1.079 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase was mostly due to lower SG&A/R&D expenses, primarily due to a reduction in short-term incentive compensation expense and lower R&D project expenses. Lower manufacturing costs were mostly offset by lower sales volume.37Table of ContentsEnergy & Transportation’s profit as a percent of total sales was 19.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with 17.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018.Financial Products SegmentFinancial Products’ segment revenues were $846 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of $34 million, or 4 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase was primarily due to a favorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment in Europe and higher average financing rates in North America.Financial Products’ segment profit was $210 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared with $29 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Most of the increase was due to lower provision for credit losses at Cat Financial, driven by a lower allowance rate compared with 2018. The lower allowance rate was due to write-offs of accounts in 2019 that were reserved for in 2018, primarily in the Cat Power Finance portfolio. In addition, there was a favorable impact from equity securities in Insurance Services, as well as favorable impacts from an increase in net yield on average earning assets and returned or repossessed equipment. These favorable impacts were partially offset by higher SG&A expenses.Corporate Items and EliminationsExpense for corporate items and eliminations was $331 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of $10 million from the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase was primarily due to methodology differences, offset by timing differences and lower restructuring costs.2018 COMPARED WITH 2017 CONSOLIDATED SALES AND REVENUESThe chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated sales and revenues between 2017 (at left) and 2018 (at right). Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company’s Board of Directors and employees.Total sales and revenues were $54.722 billion in 2018, an increase of $9.260 billion, or 20 percent, compared with $45.462 billion in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume driven by improved demand for equipment across the three primary segments, including changes in dealer inventories. Favorable price realization across the three primary segments also contributed to the sales improvement. In addition, sales were higher due to currency impacts, primarily from a stronger euro. Financial Products’ revenues increased slightly.Sales increased in all regions, with the largest sales increase in North America, which improved 23 percent as strong economic conditions in key end markets drove higher demand. Also contributing to higher sales was an increase in dealer inventories during 2018, compared with dealer inventories that were about flat in 2017.Sales increased 13 percent in Latin America primarily due to stabilizing economic conditions in several countries in the region that resulted in improved demand from low levels. EAME sales increased 16 percent primarily due to higher demand, including changes in dealer inventories. The improvement in demand was primarily in Europe. The impact of a stronger euro and favorable price realization also contributed to higher sales. Dealer inventories increased more significantly in 2018 than in 2017.38Table of ContentsAsia/Pacific sales increased 28 percent primarily due to higher demand in several countries across the region, including changes in dealer inventories and favorable price realization. Dealer inventories increased during 2018 as compared with dealer inventories that were about flat in 2017.Dealer machine and engine inventories increased about $2.3 billion in 2018, compared with an increase of about $100 million in 2017. Dealers are independent, and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers’ demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers.Sales and Revenues by

Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company’s Board of Directors and employees. The bar entitled Other includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy & Transportation other operating (income) expenses.Operating profit was $8.293 billion in 2018, an increase of $3.833 billion, or 86 percent, compared with $4.460 billion in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume and lower restructuring costs. Higher manufacturing costs and increased SG&A/R&D expenses were mostly offset by favorable price realization.Manufacturing costs were higher due to increased material and freight costs, partially offset by lower warranty expense. Material costs were higher primarily due to increases in steel prices. The impact of tariffs on material costs was about $110 million during 2018. Freight costs were unfavorable primarily due to supply chain inefficiencies as the industry responds to strong global demand.SG&A/R&D expenses increased primarily due to investments aligned with the company’s strategic growth initiatives.Restructuring costs were $394 million in 2018, related to restructuring actions across the company. In 2017, we incurred $1.227 billion of restructuring costs with about half related to the closure of the facility in Gosselies, Belgium, and the remainder related to other restructuring actions across the company.Short-term incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance, measured against targets set annually. Short-term incentive compensation expense in 2018 was about $1.4 billion, nearly the same as 2017.

The unfavorable change was primarily a result of an unfavorable impact from equity securities in Insurance Services. Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted a new U.S. GAAP accounting rule that requires our equity securities to be measured at fair value through earnings. Previously, the fair value adjustments for these securities were reported in equity until the securities were sold or an impairment was recognized. We adopted the standard using the modified retrospective approach, with no change to prior year financial statements. During 2018, we recognized a loss of $33 million related to fair value adjustments.\\xa0 During 2017, we recognized gains on sales of securities of $104 million. In addition, the absence of a 2017 pretax gain of $85 million on the sale of Caterpillar’s equity investment in IronPlanet contributed to the unfavorable change.•The provision for income taxes for 2018 reflects an annual effective tax rate of 24.1 percent, compared with 27.7 percent for the full year of 2017, excluding the items discussed below. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate beginning January 1, 2018, along with other changes in the geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective. We have completed our accounting for the income tax effects of U.S. tax reform legislation and included measurement period adjustments in 2018 of $104 million to reduce the provisionally estimated charge of $2.371 billion recognized in 2017. A $154 million benefit revised the estimated impact of the write-down of U.S. net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. This benefit primarily related to the decision to make an additional discretionary pension contribution of $1.0 billion to U.S. pension plans in 2018 which was treated as deductible on the 2017 U.S. tax return. A $50 million charge revised the provisionally estimated cost of a mandatory deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings, including changes in the deferred tax liability related to the amount of earnings considered not indefinitely reinvested as well as the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and state tax liabilities associated with these tax positions.The provision for income taxes in 2018 and 2017 also included non-cash benefits of $63 million and $111 million, respectively, from reductions in the valuation allowance against U.S. state deferred tax assets due to improved profits in the United States. An additional benefit of $25 million was included in 2018 due to the release of a valuation allowance for a certain non-U.S. subsidiary. The provision for income taxes in 2018 also included a charge of $59 million to correct for an error which resulted in an understatement of the valuation allowance offsetting deferred tax assets for prior years. This error had the effect of overstating profit by $17 million and $33 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Management has concluded that the error was not material to any period presented. \\xa0In addition, a tax benefit of $56 million was recorded in 2018, compared with $64 million in 2017, for the settlement of stock-based compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP compensation expense. Construction IndustriesConstruction Industries’ total sales were $23.237 billion in 2018, compared with $19.240 billion in 2017. The increase was mostly due to higher sales volume for construction equipment. Sales were also higher due to currency impacts, primarily from a stronger euro.▪Sales volume increased primarily due to higher demand for construction equipment and changes in dealer inventories. Dealer inventories increased significantly more during 2018 than during 2017.Sales increased in all regions.▪In North America, the sales increase was primarily due to higher demand for construction equipment, primarily to support oil and gas activities, including pipelines, non-residential building construction and infrastructure activities. In addition, sales increased due to changes in dealer inventories, which increased during 2018, compared with a slight decrease during 2017.▪Although construction activities remained weak in Latin America, sales were higher in the region.▪Sales increased in EAME primarily due to higher demand and the favorable impact of currency, mostly from a stronger euro. Higher demand was driven by increased construction activities across several countries in the region. Favorable price realization also contributed to the sales increase. ▪Sales in Asia/Pacific were higher in several countries in the region, most significantly in China, stemming from increased building construction and infrastructure investment. Changes in dealer inventories contributed to the sales improvement as dealer inventories increased in 2018 and were about flat in 2017.41Table of ContentsConstruction Industries’ profit was $4.174 billion in 2018, compared with $3.255 billion in 2017. The increase in profit was a result of higher sales volume and favorable price realization, partially offset by higher material and freight costs, and increased SG&A/R&D expenses, partially due to spending for strategic growth initiatives.Construction Industries’ profit as a percent of total sales was 18.0 percent in 2018, compared with 16.9 percent in 2017.Resource IndustriesResource Industries’ total sales were $10.270 billion in 2018, an increase of $2.409 billion from 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher demand for both mining and heavy construction equipment, including aftermarket parts. Favorable commodity price levels and increased mining production contributed to higher mining equipment sales. In addition, increased sales to heavy construction, quarry and aggregate customers were driven by positive global economic growth. Resource Industries’ customers globally continue to focus on improving productivity and efficiency of existing machine assets, thereby extending equipment life cycles and lowering operating costs. Rebuild, overhaul and maintenance activity was robust, resulting in higher aftermarket parts sales. Favorable price realization also contributed to the sales improvement. Resource Industries’ profit was $1.603 billion in 2018, compared with $698 million in 2017. The improvement was mostly due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization, partially offset by increased manufacturing costs and unfavorable currency impacts. Manufacturing costs were unfavorable as lower warranty expense was more than offset by higher freight and material costs.Resource Industries’ profit as a percent of total sales was 15.6 percent in 2018, compared with 8.9 percent in 2017.Energy & TransportationSales by Application\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(Millions of dollars)\\xa02018\\xa02017\\xa0$Change\\xa0%\\xa0ChangeOil and Gas\\xa0$5,763\\xa0$4,424\\xa0$1,339\\xa030%Power Generation\\xa04,334\\xa03,551\\xa0783\\xa022%Industrial\\xa03,640\\xa03,445\\xa0195\\xa06%Transportation\\xa05,095\\xa04,544\\xa0551\\xa012%External Sales\\xa018,832\\xa015,964\\xa02,868\\xa018%Inter-Segment\\xa03,953\\xa03,418\\xa0535\\xa016%Total Sales\\xa0$22,785\\xa0$19,382\\xa0$3,403\\xa018%\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Energy & Transportation’s total sales were $22.785 billion in 2018, compared with $19.382 billion in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volume across all applications. Favorable price realization also contributed to the increase in sales.•Oil and Gas – Sales increased due to higher demand in North America for well servicing and gas compression applications. Growth in U.S. onshore oil and gas drove increased sales for reciprocating engines and related aftermarket parts. Sales of turbines and turbine-related services were higher for production applications.•Power Generation – Sales improved across all regions, with the largest increase in North America, primarily for reciprocating engine applications including data centers, and for aftermarket parts. In addition, sales increased in EAME from reciprocating engine projects, turbines and turbine-related services and favorable currency.•Industrial – Sales were higher in Asia/Pacific and North America, primarily due to improving economic conditions supporting higher engine sales into industrial applications. Sales in EAME were about flat as economic uncertainty in a few countries in the Middle East was mostly offset by favorable currency impacts.•Transportation – Sales were higher for rail services driven by acquisitions in Asia/Pacific and EAME and increased rail traffic in North America. Marine sales were higher in Asia/Pacific, led by increased activity in the ferry sector.Energy & Transportation’s profit was $3.938 billion in 2018, compared with $2.856 billion in 2017. The improvement was due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization. This was partially offset due to increased spending for strategic growth initiatives and higher freight costs.Energy & Transportation’s profit as a percent of total sales was 17.3 percent in 2018, compared with 14.7 percent in 2017.42Table of ContentsFinancial Products SegmentFinancial Products’ segment revenues were $3.279 billion, an increase of $186 million, or 6 percent, from 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher average financing rates and higher average earning assets in North America and Asia/Pacific. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower intercompany lending activity in North America, lower average earning assets in Latin America and lower average financing rates in Europe.Financial Products’ segment profit was $505 million in 2018, compared with $792 million in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in the provision for credit losses at Cat Financial, an unfavorable impact from equity securities in Insurance Services and lower intercompany lending activity. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by higher average earning assets and an increase in net yield on average earning assets.At the end of 2018, past dues at Cat Financial were 3.55 percent, compared with 2.78 percent at the end of 2017. Write-offs, net of recoveries, were $189 million for 2018, compared with $114 million for 2017. As of December 31, 2018, Cat Financial’s allowance for credit losses totaled $511 million, or 1.80 percent of finance receivables, compared with $365 million, or 1.33 percent of finance receivables at December 31, 2017. The increase in past dues, write-offs and allowance for credit losses was primarily due to weakening in the Cat Power Finance portfolio.Corporate Items and EliminationsExpense for corporate items and eliminations was $1.566 billion in 2018, a decrease of $1.209 billion from 2017. The decrease in expense was mostly due to lower restructuring costs and methodology differences. Restructuring costs were $394 million in 2018. In 2017, restructuring costs impacting operating profit were $1.227 billion with about half related to the closure of the facility in Gosselies, Belgium and the remainder related to other restructuring actions across the company. RESTRUCTURING COSTSRestructuring costs for 2019, 2018, and 2017 were as follows:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(Millions\\xa0of\\xa0dollars)\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017Employee separations 1\\xa0$48\\xa0$112\\xa0$525Contract terminations 1\\xa01\\xa07\\xa0183Long-lived asset impairments 1\\xa065\\xa093\\xa0346Defined benefit plan curtailments and termination benefits 2\\xa0—\\xa0(8)\\xa029Other 3\\xa0122\\xa0182\\xa0173Total restructuring costs\\xa0$236\\xa0$386\\xa0$1,256\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa01\\xa0Recognized in Other operating (income) expenses.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02\\xa0Recognized in Other income (expense).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa03 Represents costs related to our restructuring programs, primarily for project management, inventory write-downs, accelerated depreciation and equipment relocation, and also LIFO inventory decrement benefits from inventory liquidations at closed facilities, all of which are primarily included in Cost of goods sold.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The restructuring costs in 2019 were primarily related to restructuring actions across the company.  The restructuring costs in 2018 were primarily related to ongoing facility closures across the company.  In 2017, about half of the restructuring costs were related to the closure of the facility in  Gosselies, Belgium, within Construction Industries, and the remainder was related to other restructuring actions across the company. Certain restructuring costs are a reconciling item between Segment profit and Consolidated profit before taxes.43Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes the 2018 and 2019 employee separation activity:\\xa0\\xa0(Millions\\xa0of\\xa0dollars)\\xa0Liability balance at December\\xa031, 2017$249Increase in liability (separation charges)112Reduction in liability (payments)(276)Liability balance at December\\xa031, 2018$85Increase in liability (separation charges)48Reduction in liability (payments)(85)Liability balance at December\\xa031, 2019$48\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Most of the remaining liability balance as of December 31, 2019 is expected to be paid in 2020.In March 2017, Caterpillar informed Belgian authorities of the decision to proceed to a collective dismissal, which led to the closure of the Gosselies site, impacting about 2,000 employees. Production of Caterpillar products at the Gosselies site ended during the second quarter of 2017. The other operations and functions at the Gosselies site were phased out by the end of the second quarter of 2018.   The program concluded in 2018, and we incurred a total of $647 million of restructuring costs (primarily in 2017) under this program.  These costs were primarily related to employee separation costs, long-lived asset impairments and other costs which were partially offset by a LIFO inventory decrement benefit. In September 2015, we announced a large scale restructuring plan (the Plan) including a voluntary retirement enhancement program for qualifying U.S. employees, several voluntary separation programs outside of the United States, additional involuntary programs throughout the company and manufacturing facility consolidations and closures.  The largest action among those included in the Plan was related to our European manufacturing footprint which led to the Gosselies, Belgium, facility closure as discussed above.  We incurred $43 million, $121 million and $817 million of restructuring costs associated with these actions in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The Plan concluded in 2019, and total restructuring costs incurred since the inception of the Plan were $1,831 million. In 2020, we expect to incur about $300 - $400 million of restructuring costs, about half for restructuring actions across the company  and the remainder for strategic actions to address a small number of products.  We expect that prior restructuring actions will result in an incremental benefit to operating costs, primarily Costs of goods sold and SG&A expenses of about $200 million in 2020 compared with 2019.

Funding for these businesses is also available from commercial paper and long-term debt issuances. Financial Products’ operations are funded primarily from commercial paper, term debt issuances and collections from its existing portfolio. During 2019, we experienced favorable liquidity conditions globally in both our ME&T and Financial Products\\' operations. On a consolidated basis, we ended 2019 with $8.28 billion of cash, an increase of $427 million from year-end 2018. We intend to maintain a strong cash and liquidity position.\\xa0Consolidated operating cash flow for 2019 was $6.91 billion, up from $6.56 billion in 2018. The increase was due to favorable changes in working capital in 2019, mostly offset by lower profit adjusted for non-cash items, which included lower accruals for short-term incentive compensation payments, and a larger discretionary pension contribution. Within working capital, changes to inventories, accounts receivable, customer advances and accrued expenses favorably impacted cash flow but were partially offset by changes in accounts payable.  See further discussion of operating cash flow under ME&T and Financial Products.Total debt as of December\\xa031, 2019 was $37.66 billion, an increase of $1.10 billion from year-end 2018. Debt related to Financial Products decreased $43 million. Debt related to ME&T increased $1.15 billion in 2019, primarily due to the issuance of debt to finance a discretionary pension contribution, which was partially offset by the impact of new accounting guidance on a previously failed sale-leaseback transaction in Japan. On September 19, 2019, we issued $1.0 billion of 3.250% Senior Notes due 2049 and $500 million of 2.600% Senior Notes due 2029. During 2019, we repurchased $4.05 billion of Caterpillar common stock.\\xa0We have three global credit facilities with a syndicate of banks totaling $10.50 billion (Credit Facility) available in the aggregate to both Caterpillar and Cat Financial for general liquidity purposes.\\xa0Based on management’s allocation decision, which can be revised from time to time, the portion of the Credit Facility available to ME&T as of December\\xa031, 2019 was $2.75 billion. Information on our Credit Facility is as follows:46Table of Contents•The 364-day facility of $3.15 billion (of which $0.82 billion is available to ME&T) expires in September\\xa02020.•The three-year facility, as amended and restated in September 2019, of $2.73 billion (of which $0.72 billion is available to ME&T) expires in September\\xa02022.•The five-year facility, as amended and restated in September 2019, of $4.62 billion (of which $1.21 billion is available to ME&T) expires in September\\xa02024.At December\\xa031, 2019, Caterpillar’s consolidated net worth was $14.63 billion, which was above the $9.00 billion required under the Credit Facility.\\xa0 The consolidated net worth is defined as the consolidated shareholder’s equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).At December\\xa031, 2019, Cat Financial’s covenant interest coverage ratio was 1.77 to 1.\\xa0 This is above the 1.15 to 1 minimum ratio, calculated as (1)\\xa0profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to (2)\\xa0interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended, required by the Credit Facility.In addition, at December\\xa031, 2019, Cat Financial’s six-month covenant leverage ratio was 7.65 to 1 and year-end covenant leverage ratio was 7.46 to 1.\\xa0 This is below the maximum ratio of debt to net worth of 10 to 1, calculated (1)\\xa0on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2)\\xa0at each December\\xa031, required by the Credit Facility.In the event Caterpillar or Cat Financial does not meet one or more of their respective financial covenants under the Credit Facility in the future (and are unable to obtain a consent or waiver), the syndicate of banks may terminate the commitments allocated to the party that does not meet its covenants.\\xa0Additionally, in such event, certain of Cat Financial\\'s other lenders under other loan agreements where similar financial covenants or cross default provisions are applicable, may, at their election, choose to pursue remedies under those loan agreements, including accelerating the repayment of outstanding borrowings.\\xa0 At December\\xa031, 2019, there were no borrowings under the Credit Facility.Our total credit commitments and available credit as of December\\xa031, 2019 were:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0December\\xa031, 2019(Millions\\xa0of\\xa0dollars)\\xa0Consolidated\\xa0Machinery,Energy & Transportation\\xa0FinancialProductsCredit lines available:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Global credit facilities\\xa0$10,500\\xa0$2,751\\xa0$7,749Other external\\xa04,999\\xa0194\\xa04,805Total credit lines available\\xa015,499\\xa02,945\\xa012,554Less: Commercial paper outstanding\\xa0(4,168)\\xa0—\\xa0(4,168)Less: Utilized credit\\xa0(1,247)\\xa0—\\xa0(1,247)Available credit\\xa0$10,084\\xa0$2,945\\xa0$7,139\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The other consolidated credit lines with banks as of December\\xa031, 2019 totaled $5.00 billion. These committed and uncommitted credit lines, which may be eligible for renewal at various future dates or have no specified expiration date, are used primarily by our subsidiaries for local funding requirements.\\xa0 Caterpillar or Cat Financial may guarantee subsidiary borrowings under these lines. \\xa0We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies.  Moody’s rates our debt as “low-A”, while Fitch and S&P maintain a “mid-A” debt rating.  This split rating has not had a material impact on our borrowing costs or our overall financial health.   However, a downgrade of our credit ratings by any of the major credit rating agencies would result in increased borrowing costs and could make access to certain credit markets more difficult. In the event economic conditions deteriorate such that access to debt markets becomes unavailable, ME&T’s operations would rely on cash flow from operations, use of existing cash balances, borrowings from Cat Financial and access to our Credit Facility. Our Financial Products’ operations would rely on cash flow from its existing portfolio, existing cash balances, access to our Credit Facility and other credit line facilities of Cat Financial and potential borrowings from Caterpillar. In addition, we maintain a support agreement with Cat Financial, which requires Caterpillar to remain the sole owner of Cat Financial and may, under certain circumstances, require Caterpillar to make payments to Cat Financial should Cat Financial fail to maintain certain financial ratios.47Table of ContentsMachinery, Energy & Transportation\\xa0Net cash provided by operating activities was $4.87 billion in 2019, compared with $6.35 billion in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to lower profit in 2019 adjusted for non-cash items, which included lower accruals for short-term compensation payments, and a larger discretionary pension contribution partially offset by favorable changes in working capital. Within working capital, changes to inventories, accounts receivable, customer advances and accrued expenses favorably impacted cash flow but were partially offset by changes in accounts payable.Net cash used for investing activities in 2019 was $48 million, compared with net cash used of $1.19 billion in 2018. The change was primarily due to decreased ME&T lending with Financial Products during 2019 and the acquisitions of ECM S.p.A. and Downer Freight Rail in 2018.Net cash used for financing activities during 2019 was $4.48 billion, compared with net cash used of $5.47 billion in 2018. The change was primarily due to the issuance of $1.5 billion of long-term debt used to fund a discretionary pension contribution. This was partially offset by an increase in repurchases of Caterpillar common stock of $249 million and an increase in dividends paid of $181 million.\\xa0While our short-term priorities for the use of cash may vary from time to time as business needs and conditions dictate, our long-term cash deployment strategy is focused on the following priorities. Our top priority is to maintain a strong financial position in support of a Mid-A rating. Next, we intend to fund operational requirements and commitments. Then, we intend to fund priorities that profitably grow the company and return capital to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases.  Additional information on cash deployment is as follows:\\xa0Strong financial position — Our top priority is to maintain a strong financial position in support of a mid-A rating. We track a diverse group of financial metrics that focus on liquidity, leverage, cash flow and margins which align with our cash deployment actions and the various methodologies used by the major credit rating agencies.Operational excellence and commitments — Capital expenditures were $1.07 billion during 2019, compared to $1.22 billion in 2018. We expect ME&T’s capital expenditures in 2020 to be about $1.2 billion. We made $1.81 billion of contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans during 2019, including a $1.5 billion discretionary U.S. pension plan contribution. By comparison, we made $1.35 billion of contributions to our pension and other postretirement plans in 2018, including a $1.0 billion discretionary contribution made to our U.S. pension plans. We expect to make approximately $280 million of contributions to our pension and OPEB plans in 2020. \\xa0Fund strategic growth initiatives and return capital to shareholders — We intend to utilize our liquidity and debt capacity to fund targeted investments that drive long-term profitable growth focused in the areas of expanded offerings and services, including acquisitions. As part of our new capital allocation strategy, ME&T free cash flow is a liquidity measure we will use going forward to determine the cash generated and available for financing activities including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases.   We define ME&T free cash flow as cash from ME&T operations excluding discretionary pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions less capital expenditures. A goal of our new capital allocation strategy is to return substantially all ME&T free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, while maintaining our mid-A rating.Our share repurchase plans are subject to the company’s cash deployment priorities and are evaluated on an ongoing basis considering the financial condition of the company and the economic outlook, corporate cash flow, the company\\'s liquidity needs and the health and stability of global credit markets. The timing and amount of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and investing priorities. In July 2018, the Board of Directors approved an authorization to repurchase up to $10 billion of Caterpillar common stock (the 2018 Authorization) effective January 1, 2019, with no expiration. In 2019, we repurchased $4.05 billion of Caterpillar common stock, with $5.95 billion remaining under the 2018 Authorization as of December 31, 2019. Caterpillar\\'s basic shares outstanding as of December 31, 2019 were approximately 550 million.Each quarter, our Board of Directors reviews the company\\'s dividend for the applicable quarter. The Board evaluates the financial condition of the company and considers the economic outlook, corporate cash flow, the company\\'s liquidity needs, and the health and stability of global credit markets to determine whether to maintain or change the quarterly dividend. Dividends totaled $2.13 billion in 2019, representing 86 cents per share paid in each of the first and second quarters and $1.03 per share paid in each of the third and fourth quarters.48Table of ContentsFinancial Products\\xa0Financial Products operating cash flow was $1.50 billion in 2019, compared with $1.52 billion in 2018. Net cash used for investing activities was $414 million in 2019, compared with $2.78 billion in 2018.   The change was primarily due to the impact of net intercompany purchased receivables and higher collections of finance receivables. Net cash used for financing activities in 2019 was $991 million, compared with net cash provided by financing activities of $1.26 billion in 2018. The change was primarily due to lower portfolio funding requirements and lower net intercompany borrowings, partially offset by a lower dividend payment to ME&T.Contractual obligations\\xa0The company has committed cash outflow related to long-term debt, operating lease agreements, postretirement benefit obligations, purchase obligations, interest on long-term debt and other long-term contractual obligations.

Information related to guarantees appears in Note 21 – “Guarantees and product warranty” of Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1J — “New accounting guidance” of Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\xa0The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The more significant estimates include: residual values for leased assets, fair values for goodwill impairment tests, warranty liability, reserves for product liability and insurance losses, postretirement benefits, post-sale discounts, credit losses and income taxes. We have incorporated many years of data into the determination of each of these estimates and we have not historically experienced significant adjustments. These assumptions are reviewed at least annually with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Following are the methods and assumptions used in determining our estimates and an indication of the risks inherent in each.\\xa0Residual values for leased assets – The residual value of Cat Financial’s leased equipment is determined based on its estimated end-of-term market value.  We estimate the residual value of leased equipment at the inception of the lease based on a number of factors, including historical wholesale market sales prices, past remarketing experience and any known significant market/product trends.  The following critical factors are also considered in our residual value estimates: lease term, market size and demand, total expected hours of usage, machine configuration, application, location, model changes, quantities, third-party residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options. Upon termination of the lease, the equipment is either purchased by the lessee or sold to a third party, in which case we may record a gain or a loss for the difference between the estimated residual value and the sale price.During the term of our leases, we monitor residual values.\\xa0 For operating leases, adjustments to depreciation expense reflecting changes in residual value estimates are recorded prospectively on a straight-line basis.  For finance leases, residual value adjustments are recognized through a reduction of finance revenue over the remaining lease term.We evaluate the carrying value of equipment on operating leases for potential impairment when we determine a triggering event has occurred.  When a triggering event occurs, a test for recoverability is performed by comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases.  If the test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, the fair value of the equipment on operating leases is measured in accordance with the fair value measurement framework.  An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases exceeds its estimated fair value.At December 31, 2019, the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases was $2.15 billion.  Without consideration of other factors such as third-party residual guarantees or contractual customer purchase options, a 10 percent non-temporary decrease in the market value of our equipment subject to operating leases would reduce residual value estimates and result in the recognition of approximately $80 million of additional annual depreciation expense.Fair values for goodwill impairment tests – We test goodwill for impairment annually, at the reporting unit level, and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion of a reporting unit.  We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis.Goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative goodwill impairment test.  If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary.  For reporting units where we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill.  If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired.  If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, the difference would be recognized as an impairment loss. 50Table of ContentsThe impairment test process requires valuation of the respective reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on a discounted five year forecasted cash flow with a year-five residual value.  The residual value is computed using the constant growth method, which values the forecasted cash flows in perpetuity.  The income approach is supported by a reconciliation of our calculated fair value for Caterpillar to the company’s market capitalization.  The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on each reporting unit\\'s long-term forecast and are subject to review and approval by senior management. A reporting unit’s discount rate is a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital, which we believe approximates the rate from a market participant’s perspective.  The estimated fair value could be impacted by changes in market conditions, interest rates, growth rates, tax rates, costs, pricing and capital expenditures.  The fair value determination is categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs.Our annual impairment tests completed in the fourth quarter of 2019 indicated the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially above its respective carrying value, including goodwill.  Caterpillar’s market capitalization has remained significantly above the net book value of the Company.  An unfavorable change in our expectations for the financial performance of our reporting units, particularly long-term growth and profitability, would reduce the fair value of our reporting units.  The demand for our equipment and related parts is highly cyclical and significantly impacted by commodity prices, although the impact may vary by reporting unit.  The energy and mining industries are major users of our products, including the coal, iron ore, gold, copper, oil and natural gas industries.  Decisions to purchase our products are dependent upon the performance of those industries, which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices.  Lower commodity prices or industry specific circumstances that have a negative impact to the valuation assumptions may reduce the fair value of our reporting units.  Should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value has fallen below its carrying value, we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test(s), in addition to the annual impairment test. \\xa0Future impairment tests may result in a goodwill impairment, depending on the outcome of the quantitative impairment test.  A goodwill impairment would be reported as a non-cash charge to earnings.\\xa0Warranty liability – At the time a sale is recognized, we record estimated future warranty costs.\\xa0\\xa0The warranty liability is determined by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory.\\xa0\\xa0Generally, historical claim rates are based on actual warranty experience for each product by machine model/engine size by customer or dealer location (inside or outside North America).\\xa0\\xa0Specific rates are developed for each product shipment month and are updated monthly based on actual warranty claim experience.\\xa0\\xa0Warranty costs may differ from those estimated if actual claim rates are higher or lower than our historical rates.\\xa0Product liability and insurance loss reserve – We determine these reserves based upon reported claims in process of settlement and actuarial estimates for losses incurred but not reported. Loss reserves, including incurred but not reported reserves, are based on estimates and ultimate settlements may vary significantly from such estimates due to increased claims frequency or severity over historical levels.\\xa0Postretirement benefits – We sponsor defined benefit pension plans and/or other postretirement benefit plans (retirement healthcare and life insurance) to employees in many of our locations throughout the world.  There are assumptions used in the accounting for these defined benefit plans that include discount rate, expected return on plan assets, expected rate of compensation increase, the future health care trend rate, mortality and other economic and demographic assumptions.  The actuarial assumptions we use may change or differ significantly from actual results, which may result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are considered actuarial gains or losses. We utilize a mark-to-market approach in recognizing actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement.Primary actuarial assumptions were determined as follows:•The assumed discount rate is used to discount future benefit obligations back to today’s dollars.  The U.S. discount rate is based on a benefit cash flow-matching approach and represents the rate at which our benefit obligations could effectively be settled as of our measurement date, December 31.  The benefit cash flow-matching approach involves analyzing Caterpillar’s projected cash flows against a high quality bond yield curve, calculated using a wide population of corporate Aa bonds available on the measurement date.  A similar approach is used to determine the assumed discount rate for our most significant non-U.S. plans.  In estimating the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost, we utilize a full yield curve approach in determining a discount rate.  This approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. 51Table of ContentsDiscount rates are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  A decrease in the discount rate would increase our obligation and future expense.•The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on our estimate of long-term passive returns for equities and fixed income securities weighted by the allocation of our plan assets.  Based on historical performance, we increase the passive returns due to our active management of the plan assets.  This rate is impacted by changes in general market conditions, but because it represents a long-term rate, it is not significantly impacted by short-term market swings.  Changes in our allocation of plan assets would also impact this rate.  For example, a shift to more fixed income securities would lower the rate.  A decrease in the rate would increase our expense.  The expected return on plan assets is calculated using the fair value of plan assets as of our measurement date, December 31.  •The expected rate of compensation increase is used to develop benefit obligations using projected pay at retirement.  It represents average long-term salary increases.  This rate is influenced by our long-term compensation policies.  An increase in the rate would increase our obligation and expense.•The assumed health care trend rate represents the rate at which health care costs are assumed to increase and is based on historical and expected experience.  Changes in our projections of future health care costs due to general economic conditions and those specific to health care (e.g., technology driven cost changes) will impact this trend rate.  An increase in the trend rate would increase our obligation and expense.•The mortality assumption is used to estimate the life expectancy of plan participants.  An increase in the life expectancy of plan participants will result in an increase in our obligation and expense.   52Table of Contents\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Postretirement Benefit Plan Actuarial Assumptions Sensitivity\\xa0The effects of a one percentage-point change in certain actuarial assumptions on 2019 pension and OPEB costs and obligations are as follows:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02019\\xa0Benefit\\xa0Cost\\xa0Year-end\\xa0Benefit\\xa0Obligation(Millions\\xa0of\\xa0dollars)\\xa0One\\xa0percentage-point\\xa0increase\\xa0One\\xa0percentage-point\\xa0decrease\\xa0One\\xa0percentage-point\\xa0increase\\xa0One\\xa0percentage-point\\xa0decreaseU.S. Pension benefits:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Assumed discount rate\\xa0$54\\xa0$(71)\\xa0$(1,893)\\xa0$2,305Expected rate of compensation increase\\xa02\\xa0(2)\\xa0—\\xa0—Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets\\xa0(122)\\xa0122\\xa0—\\xa0—Non-U.S. Pension benefits:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Assumed discount rate\\xa07\\xa0(10)\\xa0(634)\\xa0610Expected rate of compensation increase\\xa05\\xa0(4)\\xa041\\xa0(35)Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets\\xa0(39)\\xa039\\xa0—\\xa0—Other postretirement benefits:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Assumed discount rate\\xa08\\xa0(10)\\xa0(366)\\xa0437Expected rate of compensation increase\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa01\\xa0(1)Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets\\xa0(3)\\xa03\\xa0—\\xa0—Assumed health care cost trend rate\\xa013\\xa0(11)\\xa0158\\xa0(133)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Actuarial Assumptions\\xa0\\xa0U.S.\\xa0Pension\\xa0Benefits\\xa0Non-U.S.\\xa0Pension\\xa0Benefits\\xa0Other\\xa0Postretirement\\xa0Benefits\\xa0\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligation, end of year:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Discount rate\\xa03.2%\\xa04.2%\\xa03.5%\\xa01.9%\\xa02.5%\\xa02.4%\\xa03.2%\\xa04.2%\\xa03.6%Rate of compensation increase 1\\xa0—%\\xa04.0%\\xa04.0%\\xa02.0%\\xa03.0%\\xa04.0%\\xa04.0%\\xa04.0%\\xa04.0%\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Discount rate used to measure service cost\\xa04.3%\\xa03.7%\\xa04.2%\\xa02.5%\\xa02.3%\\xa02.4%\\xa04.1%\\xa03.5%\\xa03.9%Discount rate used to measure interest cost\\xa03.9%\\xa03.2%\\xa03.3%\\xa02.3%\\xa02.2%\\xa02.3%\\xa03.9%\\xa03.2%\\xa03.3%Expected rate of return on plan assets\\xa05.9%\\xa06.3%\\xa06.7%\\xa03.8%\\xa05.2%\\xa05.9%\\xa07.2%\\xa07.5%\\xa07.5%Rate of compensation increase\\xa04.0%\\xa04.0%\\xa04.0%\\xa03.0%\\xa04.0%\\xa04.0%\\xa04.1%\\xa04.0%\\xa04.0%\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Health care cost trend rates at year-end:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Health care trend rate assumed for next year\\xa06.1%\\xa06.1%\\xa06.1%Rate that the cost trend rate gradually declines to\\xa05.0%\\xa05.0%\\xa05.0%Year that the cost trend rate reaches ultimate rate\\xa02025\\xa02025\\xa02022\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa01   Effective December 31, 2019, all U.S. pension benefits were frozen, and accordingly this assumption is no longer applicable.  \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0See Note 12 -  “Postemployment benefit plans” of Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statement and Supplemental Data” for further information regarding the accounting for postretirement benefits.\\xa053Table of ContentsPost-sale discount reserve – We provide discounts to dealers through merchandising programs.  We have numerous programs that are designed to promote the sale of our products.  The most common dealer programs provide a discount when the dealer sells a product to a targeted end user.  The amount of accrued post-sale discounts was $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\\xa0\\xa0The reserve represents discounts that we expect to pay on previously sold units and is reviewed at least quarterly.  The reserve is adjusted if discounts paid differ from those estimated.  Historically, those adjustments have not been material.\\xa0Credit loss reserve – The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the losses inherent in our finance receivable portfolio and includes consideration of accounts that have been individually identified as impaired, as well as pools of finance receivables where it is probable that certain receivables in the pool are impaired but the individual accounts cannot yet be identified. \\xa0 In identifying and measuring impairment, management takes into consideration past loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of underlying collateral and current economic conditions.\\xa0\\xa0Accounts are identified for individual review based on past-due status and information available about the customer, such as financial statements, news reports and published credit ratings, as well as general information regarding industry trends and the economic environment in which our customers operate.  The allowance for credit losses attributable to finance receivables that are individually evaluated and determined to be impaired is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables’ effective interest rate, the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent receivables or the observable market price of the receivable.  \\xa0In determining collateral value, we estimate the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs.  We also consider credit enhancements such as additional collateral and contractual third-party guarantees. The allowance for credit losses attributable to the remaining accounts not yet individually identified as impaired is estimated based on loss forecast models utilizing probabilities of default, our estimate of the loss emergence period and the estimated loss given default.\\xa0\\xa0In addition, qualitative factors not able to be fully captured in our loss forecast models including industry trends, macroeconomic factors and model imprecision are considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses.\\xa0\\xa0These qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment.While management believes it has exercised prudent judgment and applied reasonable assumptions, there can be no assurance that in the future, changes in economic conditions or other factors would not cause changes in the financial health of our customers. If the financial health of our customers deteriorates, the timing and level of payments received could be impacted and therefore, could result in a change to our estimated losses.Income taxes – We are subject to the income tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate.\\xa0 These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation.\\xa0 In establishing the provision for income taxes, we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws.\\xa0 Our income tax positions and analysis are based on currently enacted tax law.\\xa0 Future changes in tax law or related interpretations could significantly impact the provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, and the deferred tax asset and liability balances.  Changes in tax law are reflected in the period of enactment with related interpretations considered in the period received.\\xa0 Despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, we believe that taxing authorities could challenge certain positions. Settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. We record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions based upon management’s evaluation of the information available at the reporting date.\\xa0 To be recognized in the financial statements, a tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on technical merits.\\xa0 The benefit for positions meeting the recognition threshold is measured as the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information.\\xa0 Significant judgment is required in making these determinations and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits may be necessary to reflect actual taxes payable upon settlement.\\xa0 Adjustments related to positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes.\\xa0 Adjustments related to positions impacting the timing of deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities.  For tax years 2007 to 2012 including the impact of a loss carryback to 2005, the IRS has proposed to tax in the United States profits earned from certain parts transactions by Caterpillar SARL (CSARL), based on the IRS examination team’s application of “substance-over-form” or “assignment-of-income” judicial doctrines. CSARL is primarily taxable locally in Switzerland.\\xa0 We are vigorously contesting the proposed increases to tax and penalties for these years of approximately $2.3 billion. We believe that the relevant transactions complied with applicable tax laws and did not violate judicial doctrines. The purchase of parts by CSARL from unrelated parties and the subsequent sale of those parts to unrelated dealers outside the United States have substantial legal, commercial, and economic consequences for the parties involved.\\xa0\\xa0 Therefore, we have concluded that the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained related to this position is the entire benefit.\\xa0 As a result, no amount related to these IRS adjustments is reflected in unrecognized tax benefits. We have filed U.S. income tax returns on this same basis for years after 2012.\\xa0 We currently believe the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations.54Table of ContentsDeferred tax assets generally represent tax benefits for tax deductions or credits available in future tax returns.\\xa0 Certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\\xa0 In making this assessment, management analyzes the trend of U.S. GAAP earnings and estimates the impact of future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and available prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.\\xa0 We give less weight in this analysis to mark-to-market adjustments to remeasure our pension and OPEB plans as we do not consider these adjustments indicative of ongoing earnings trends. Should a change in facts or circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the ultimate realizability of a deferred tax asset, we record or adjust the related valuation allowance in the period that the change in facts and circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes.\\xa0Additional information related to income taxes is included in Note 6 - “Income taxes” of Part II, Item 8 “Financial statements and Supplementary Data.” OTHER MATTERS\\xa0ENVIRONMENTAL AND LEGAL MATTERS The Company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines. We have made, and will continue to make, significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards.We are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, the investigation, remediation, and operating and maintenance costs are accrued against our earnings. Costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site, including available technologies, current applicable laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, we accrue the minimum. Where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved, we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs. In formulating the estimate of probable costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others. We reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis. The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in Accrued expenses. We believe there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all the sites in the aggregate, will be required.On January 27, 2020, the Brazilian Federal Environmental Agency (“IBAMA”) issued Caterpillar Brasil Ltda a notice of violation regarding allegations around the requirements for use of imported oils at the Piracicaba, Brazil facility.\\xa0 We have instituted processes to address the allegations.\\xa0 While we are still discussing resolution of these allegations with IBAMA, the initial notice from IBAMA included a proposed fine of approximately $370,000.\\xa0 We do not expect this fine or our response to address the allegations to have a material adverse effect on the Company\\'s consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. On January 7, 2015, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois. The subpoena requests documents and information from the Company relating to, among other things, financial information concerning U.S. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries (including undistributed profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries and the movement of cash among U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries). The Company has received additional subpoenas relating to this investigation requesting additional documents and information relating to, among other things, the purchase and resale of replacement parts by Caterpillar Inc. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries, dividend distributions of certain non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries, and Caterpillar SARL and related structures. On March 2-3, 2017, agents with the Department of Commerce, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Internal Revenue Service executed search and seizure warrants at\\xa0three facilities of the Company in the Peoria, Illinois area, including its former corporate headquarters. The warrants identify, and agents seized, documents and information related to, among other things, the export of products from the United States, the movement of products between the United States and Switzerland, the relationship between Caterpillar Inc. and Caterpillar SARL, and sales outside the United States. It is the Company’s understanding that the warrants, which concern both tax and export activities, are related to the ongoing grand jury investigation. The Company is continuing to cooperate with this investigation. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.55Table of ContentsOn March 20, 2014, Brazil’s Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) published a Technical Opinion which named 18 companies and over 100 individuals as defendants, including two subsidiaries of Caterpillar Inc., MGE - Equipamentos e Serviços Ferroviários Ltda. (MGE) and Caterpillar Brasil Ltda. The publication of the Technical Opinion opened CADE’s official administrative investigation into allegations that the defendants participated in anticompetitive bid activity for the construction and maintenance of metro and train networks in Brazil. While companies cannot be held criminally liable for anticompetitive conduct in Brazil, criminal charges have been brought against one current employee of MGE and two former employees of MGE involving the same conduct alleged by CADE. On July 8, 2019, CADE found MGE, one of its current employees and two of its former employees liable for anticompetitive conduct. CBL was dismissed from the proceeding without any finding of liability. MGE intends to appeal CADE\\'s findings. We currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.In addition, we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed asbestos exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters, intellectual property rights, taxes (other than income taxes) and securities laws. The aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities, if any, associated with these unresolved legal actions is not material. In some cases, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter. However, we believe there is no more than a remote chance that any liability arising from these matters would be material. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions, we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. \\xa0RETIREMENT BENEFITSWe recognize mark-to-market gains and losses immediately through earnings upon the remeasurement of our pension and OPEB plans.  Mark-to-market gains and losses represent the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions.  Changes in discount rates and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets generally have the largest impact on mark-to-market gains and losses. The table below summarizes the amounts of net periodic benefit cost recognized for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and includes  expected cost for 2020. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(Millions\\xa0of\\xa0dollars)\\xa02020 Expected\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017U.S. Pension Benefits\\xa0$(308)\\xa0$(7)\\xa0$(149)\\xa0$(85)Non-U.S. Pension Benefits\\xa0(4)\\xa019\\xa0(69)\\xa0(22)Other Postretirement Benefits\\xa0150\\xa0158\\xa0138\\xa0148Mark-to-market loss (gain)\\xa0—1\\xa0468\\xa0495\\xa0301Total net periodic benefit cost (benefit)\\xa0$(162)\\xa0$638\\xa0$415\\xa0$342\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa01 Expected net periodic benefit cost (benefit) does not include an estimate for mark-to-market gains or losses.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0•Expected decrease in expense in 2020 compared to 2019 - Excluding the impact of mark-to-market gains and losses, our net periodic benefit cost is expected to decrease $332 million in 2020.  This decrease is primarily due to lower interest cost as a result of lower discount rates at year-end 2019, elimination of service cost for our U.S. pension plans freezing benefit accruals and higher expected return on plan assets due to a higher asset base at year-end 2019.•Increase in expense in 2019 compared to 2018 - Primarily due to lower expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an expected rate of return of 5.9 percent in 2019 compared to 6.3 percent in 2018) and higher interest costs due to higher discount rates at year-end 2018.•Increase in expense in 2018 compared to 2017 - Primarily due to higher net mark-to-market losses in 2018 compared to 2017.  This was partially offset by a higher expected return on plan assets and curtailment gains compared to curtailment and termination charges in 2017.The primary factors that resulted in mark-to-market losses for 2019, 2018 and 2017 are described below.  The net mark-to-market losses were included in Other income (expense) in the Results of Operations.56Table of Contents•2019 net mark-to-market loss of $468 million - Primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2019 compared to the end of 2018.  This was partially offset by a higher actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual rate of return of 22.3 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 5.9 percent).•2018 net mark-to-market loss of $495 million - Primarily due to the difference between the actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual rate of return of negative 5.4 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 6.3 percent).  This was partially offset by higher discount rates at the end of 2018 compared to the end of 2017. •2017 net mark-to-market loss of $301 million - Primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of 2017 compared to the end of 2016 and changes in our mortality assumption (discussed below).  This was partially offset by the difference between the actual return on plan assets compared to the expected return on plan assets (U.S. pension plans had an actual rate of return of 15.5 percent compared to an expected rate of return of 6.7 percent).In the fourth quarter of 2017, the company reviewed and made changes to the mortality assumptions primarily for our U.S. pension plans which resulted in an overall increase in the life expectancy of plan participants.  As of December 31, 2017 these changes resulted in an increase in our Liability for postemployment benefits of approximately $290 million. In the first quarter of 2017, we announced the closure of our Gosselies, Belgium facility.  This announcement impacted certain employees that participated in a defined benefit pension plan and resulted in a net loss of $20 million in the first quarter of 2017 for curtailment and termination benefits. SENSITIVITY\\xa0Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitivity\\xa0ME&T operations use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow.  Our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow.  Our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to approximately five years.  Based on the anticipated and firmly committed cash inflow and outflow for our ME&T operations for the next 12 months and the foreign currency derivative instruments in place at year-end, a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to all other currencies would adversely affect our expected 2020 cash flow for our ME&T operations by approximately $225 million.  Last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential $250 million adverse impact on 2019 cash flow.\\xa0\\xa0We determine our net exposures by calculating the difference in cash inflow and outflow by currency and adding or subtracting outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments.  We multiply these net amounts by 10 percent to determine the sensitivity.\\xa0In managing foreign currency risk for our Financial Products operations, our objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Since our policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between our assets and liabilities and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies, a 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to all other currencies would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow.  Neither our policy nor the effect of a 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar has changed from that reported at the end of last year.The effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables, including competitive risk.  If it were possible to quantify this competitive impact, the results would probably be different from the sensitivity effects shown above.  In addition, it is unlikely that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the U.S. dollar.  In reality, some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen.  Our primary exposure (excluding competitive risk) is to exchange rate movements in the Swiss franc, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, Indian rupee, and Australian dollar.\\xa0Interest Rate Sensitivity\\xa0For our ME&T operations, we have the option to use interest rate contracts to lower the cost of borrowed funds by attaching fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts to fixed-rate debt, and by entering into forward rate agreements on future debt issuances.\\xa0 A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would have a minimal impact to the 2020 pre-tax earnings of ME&T.  Last year, similar assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2019 pre-tax earnings. \\xa057Table of ContentsFor our Financial Products operations, we use interest rate derivative instruments primarily to meet our match-funding objectives and strategies.  We have a match-funding policy that addresses the interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate and duration) of our debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of our finance receivable portfolio within predetermined range on an ongoing basis.  In connection with that policy, we use interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the finance receivable portfolio.  Match funding reduces the volatility of margins between interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities, regardless of which direction interest rates move.\\xa0In order to properly manage sensitivity to changes in interest rates, Financial Products measures the potential impact of different interest rate assumptions on pre-tax earnings.  All on-balance sheet positions, including derivative financial instruments, are included in the analysis.  The primary assumptions included in the analysis are that there are no new fixed rate assets or liabilities, the proportion of fixed rate debt to fixed rate assets remains unchanged and the level of floating rate assets and debt remain constant.  An analysis of the December\\xa031, 2019 balance sheet, using these assumptions, estimates the impact of a 100 basis point immediate and sustained adverse change in interest rates to have a minimal impact on 2020 pre-tax earnings.\\xa0\\xa0Last year, similar assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2019 pre-tax earnings.\\xa0This analysis does not necessarily represent our current outlook of future market interest rate movement, nor does it consider any actions management could undertake in response to changes in interest rates.  Accordingly, no assurance can be given that actual results would be consistent with the results of our estimate.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESThe following definitions are provided for the non-GAAP financial measures used in this report. \\xa0These non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures for other companies.\\xa0\\xa0Management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures.We believe it is important to separately quantify the profit impact of several significant items in order for our results to be meaningful to our readers. These items consist of (i) pension and OPEB mark-to-market losses resulting from plan remeasurements, (ii) U.S. tax reform impact, (iii) restructuring costs in 2018, which were incurred to generate longer-term benefits and (iv) certain deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments. We do not consider these items indicative of earnings from ongoing business activities and believe the non-GAAP measures will provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business results and trends and aid with assessing our period-over-period results. In addition, we provide a calculation of ME&T free cash flow as we believe it is an important measure for investors to determine the cash generation available for financing activities including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases.

REPORTING\\xa0The management of Caterpillar\\xa0Inc. (company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule\\xa013a-15(f) under the Exchange Act.\\xa0 Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)\\xa0pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)\\xa0provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)\\xa0provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\xa0Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\xa0Management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December\\xa031, 2019. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment we concluded that, as of December\\xa031, 2019, the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.\\xa0The effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December\\xa031, 2019 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Their report appears on pages\\xa066-67.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0/s/ D. James Umpleby III\\xa0\\xa0D.

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.Basis for OpinionsThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)\\xa0pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)\\xa0provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)\\xa0provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.66Table of ContentsBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Uncertain Tax Position - Caterpillar SARL IRS ExaminationAs described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, as a result of the audits of the Company’s U.S. 2007 to 2012 income tax returns, including the impact of a loss carryback to 2005, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has proposed to tax in the U.S. profits earned from certain parts transactions by Caterpillar SARL (“CSARL”). This proposal is based on the IRS examination team’s application of the “substance-over-form” or “assignment-of-income” judicial doctrines. As described by management, the Company is vigorously contesting the proposed increases to tax and penalties for these years of approximately $2.3 billion, as management believes that the relevant transactions complied with applicable tax laws and did not violate judicial doctrines. As disclosed by management, the purchase of parts by CSARL from unrelated parties and the subsequent sale of those parts to unrelated dealers outside the U.S. have substantial legal, commercial, and economic consequences for the parties involved. Management has concluded that the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained related to this position is the entire benefit. As a result, no amount related to these IRS adjustments is reflected in the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits. The Company has filed U.S. income tax returns on this same basis for years after 2012.   The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the uncertain tax position arising from the CSARL IRS Examination is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management in evaluating the amount of the benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained related to the position, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures to evaluate whether the position was more likely than not to be sustained. Also, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the audit evidence obtained from these procedures.   Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the uncertain tax position arising from the CSARL IRS Examination. These procedures also included, among others, (i) evaluating management’s process for determining the reasonableness of the uncertain tax position, including reading certain intercompany and third-party agreements which are relevant to evaluating the legal form and substance of the CSARL transaction flows; (ii) evaluating management’s assessment of whether the position was more likely than not to produce a tax benefit and the determination by management of the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained related to this position; and (iii) evaluating the Revenue Agent Reports (“RARs”) from the IRS and management’s protests of the RARs. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the applicable tax laws and judicial doctrines related to this matter as well as changes in relevant tax regulations, rulings, and case law.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPPeoria, IllinoisFebruary\\xa019, 2020We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1925. \\xa067Table of

policies\\xa0A.Nature of operations\\xa0Information in our financial statements and related commentary are presented in the following categories:\\xa0Machinery, Energy & Transportation (ME&T) – Represents the aggregate total of Construction Industries, Resource Industries, Energy & Transportation and All Other operating segment and related corporate items and eliminations.\\xa0Financial Products – Primarily includes the company’s Financial Products Segment.\\xa0 This category includes Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation (Cat Financial), Caterpillar Insurance Holdings Inc. (Insurance Services) and their respective subsidiaries.\\xa0Our products are sold primarily under the brands “Caterpillar,” “CAT,” design versions of “CAT” and “Caterpillar,” “EMD,” “FG Wilson,” “MaK,” “MWM,” “Perkins,” “Progress Rail,” “SEM” and “Solar Turbines”.\\xa0We conduct operations in our ME&T lines of business under highly competitive conditions, including intense price competition. We place great emphasis on the high quality and performance of our products and our dealers’ service support. Although no one competitor is believed to produce all of the same types of equipment that we do, there are numerous companies, large and small, which compete with us in the sale of each of our products.\\xa0Our machines are distributed principally through a worldwide organization of dealers (dealer network), 46 located in the United States and 119 located outside the United States, serving 191 countries.\\xa0\\xa0Reciprocating engines are sold principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in products. Some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by our subsidiary Perkins Engines Company Limited, are also sold through its worldwide network of 67 distributors covering 178 countries.  The FG Wilson branded electric power generation systems primarily manufactured by our subsidiary Caterpillar Northern Ireland Limited are sold through its worldwide network of 150 distributors covering 109 countries.\\xa0\\xa0Some of the large, medium speed reciprocating engines are also sold\\xa0under the MaK brand through a worldwide network of 20 distributors covering 130 countries.\\xa0\\xa0Our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products; however, in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers’ principal business. Some products, primarily turbines and locomotives, are sold directly to end customers through sales forces employed by the company. At times, these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives.\\xa0The Financial Products line of business also conducts operations under highly competitive conditions. Financing for users of Caterpillar products is available through a variety of competitive sources, principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies. We offer various financing plans designed to increase the opportunity for sales of our products and generate financing income for our company. A significant portion of Financial Products activity is conducted in North America, with additional offices in Latin America, Asia/Pacific, Europe, Africa and the Middle East.B.Basis of presentation\\xa0The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Caterpillar\\xa0Inc. and its subsidiaries where we have a controlling financial interest.Investments in companies where our ownership exceeds 20 percent and we do not have a controlling interest or where the ownership is less than 20 percent and for which we have a significant influence are accounted for by the equity method.\\xa0\\xa0We consolidate all variable interest entities (VIEs) where Caterpillar Inc. is the primary beneficiary.\\xa0 For VIEs, we assess whether we are the primary beneficiary as prescribed by the accounting guidance on the consolidation of VIEs.\\xa0 The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.  See Note 21 for further discussion on a consolidated VIE.We have affiliates, suppliers and dealers that are VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary.  Although we have provided financial support, we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of each entity.  Our maximum exposure to loss from these VIEs for which we are not the primary beneficiary was $133 million and $131 million as of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 74Table of ContentsCat Financial has end-user customers that are VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary.  Although we have provided financial support to these entities and therefore have a variable interest, we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance.  Our maximum exposure to loss from our involvement with these VIEs is limited to the credit risk inherently present in the financial support that we have provided.  These risks are evaluated and reflected in our financial statements as part of our overall portfolio of finance receivables and related allowance for credit losses.Shipping and handling costs are included in Cost of goods sold in Statement 1.\\xa0\\xa0Other operating (income) expenses primarily include Cat Financial’s depreciation of equipment leased to others, Insurance Services’ underwriting expenses, (gains) losses on disposal of long-lived assets, long-lived asset impairment charges, legal settlements and accruals, contract termination costs and employee separation charges.\\xa0Prepaid expenses and other current assets in Statement 3 primarily include prepaid insurance, contract assets, right of return assets, prepaid and refundable income taxes, assets held for sale, core to be returned for remanufacturing, restricted cash and other short-term investments.Certain amounts for prior years have been reclassified to conform with the current-year financial statement presentation. C. Inventories\\xa0Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is principally determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The value of inventories on the LIFO basis represented about 60 percent and 65 percent of total inventories at December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, respectively. \\xa0If the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method had been in use, inventories would have been $2,086 million and $2,009 million higher than reported at December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, respectively.D.Depreciation and amortization\\xa0Depreciation of plant and equipment is computed principally using accelerated methods. Depreciation on equipment leased to others, primarily for Financial Products, is computed using the straight-line method over the term of the lease. The depreciable basis is the original cost of the equipment less the estimated residual value of the equipment at the end of the lease term. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, Cat Financial depreciation on equipment leased to others was $813 million, $819 million and $810 million, respectively, and was included in Other operating (income) expenses in Statement 1. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, consolidated depreciation expense was $2,253 million, $2,435 million and $2,555 million, respectively. Amortization of purchased finite-lived intangibles is computed principally using the straight-line method, generally not to exceed a period of 20 years.\\xa0E.Foreign currency translation\\xa0The functional currency for most of our ME&T consolidated companies is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for most of our Financial Products and affiliates accounted for under the equity method is the respective local currency.\\xa0\\xa0Gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of foreign currency amounts to the functional currency are included in Other income (expense) in Statement 1. Gains and losses resulting from translating assets and liabilities from the functional currency to U.S. dollars are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in Statement 3.\\xa0F.Derivative financial instruments\\xa0Our earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.\\xa0\\xa0Our Risk Management Policy (policy) allows for the use of derivative financial instruments to prudently manage foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price exposures.  Our policy specifies that derivatives are not to be used for speculative purposes.  Derivatives that we use are primarily foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts, interest rate contracts and commodity forward and option contracts.  All derivatives are recorded at fair value.\\xa0\\xa0See Note 4 for more information.75G.Income taxes\\xa0The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach taking into account guidance related to uncertain tax positions.\\xa0\\xa0Tax laws require items to be included in tax filings at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements.\\xa0\\xa0A current liability is recognized for the estimated taxes payable for the current year.\\xa0\\xa0Deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid.\\xa0\\xa0Deferred taxes are adjusted for enacted changes in tax rates and tax laws.\\xa0\\xa0Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.  See Note 6 for further discussion.H.Goodwill\\xa0For acquisitions accounted for as a business combination, goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired.\\xa0 We are required to test goodwill for impairment, at the reporting unit level, annually and when events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred.\\xa0 A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component) to which goodwill is assigned when initially recorded.  We assign goodwill to reporting units based on our integration plans and the expected synergies resulting from the acquisition.\\xa0\\xa0Because Caterpillar is a highly integrated company, the businesses we acquire are sometimes combined with or integrated into existing reporting units.\\xa0 When changes occur in the composition of our operating segments or reporting units, goodwill is reassigned to the affected reporting units based on their relative fair values.\\xa0We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October\\xa01 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis.\\xa0 Goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative goodwill impairment test.\\xa0\\xa0If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary.\\xa0 For reporting units where we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill.\\xa0 If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill is not considered impaired.\\xa0 If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, the difference would be recognized as an impairment loss.  See Note 10 for further details.I.Estimates in financial statements\\xa0The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The more significant estimates include: residual values for leased assets; fair values for goodwill impairment tests; warranty liability and reserves for product liability and insurance losses, postretirement benefits, post-sale discounts, credit losses and income taxes.J.New accounting guidance\\xa0Adoption of new accounting standardsLease accounting - (Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02) - In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued accounting guidance that revises the accounting for leases.  Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for substantially all leases.  The new guidance continues to classify leases as either financing or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition.  The accounting applied by a lessor under the new guidance is substantially equivalent to prior lease accounting guidance.  The new guidance was effective January 1, 2019 and was applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2019.  The prior period comparative information has not been recast and continues to be reported under the accounting guidance in effect for those periods.The new guidance provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition.  We elected the “package of practical expedients,” which allows us not to reassess under the new guidance our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs.  We did not elect the use-of-hindsight practical expedient. In addition, the new guidance provides practical expedients for an entity’s ongoing lessee accounting.  For certain property and information technology equipment leases, we have elected to separate payments for lease components from non-lease components. For all other leases, we have elected not to separate lease and non-lease components.  We have elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify, which means we have not recognized right-of-use assets or lease liabilities for these leases with a term of twelve months or less.76Table of ContentsThe most significant effects of adoption relate to the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on our balance sheet for operating leases and providing new disclosures about our leasing activities.  In addition, we derecognized existing assets and debt obligations for a sale-leaseback transaction that qualified for sale accounting under the new guidance.  The gain associated with this change in accounting was recognized through opening retained earnings as of January 1, 2019.  The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements.In March 2019, the FASB issued Leases - Codification improvements (ASU 2019-01) which amended the new leasing guidance.  Under these amendments, lessors that are not manufacturers or dealers will use their cost, less any discounts that may apply, as the fair value of the underlying asset, and lessors within the scope of Financial Services-Depository and Lending guidance will present all principal payments received under leases within investment activities on the statement of cash flows.\\xa0 We adopted the new guidance effective January 1, 2019, and the adoption did not have a material impact to our financial statements.See Note 20 for additional information. The cumulative effect of initially applying the new lease guidance to our consolidated financial statements on January 1, 2019 was as follows:Consolidated Statement of Financial Position\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(Millions of dollars)\\xa0Balance as of December 31, 2018\\xa0Cumulative Impact from Adopting New Lease Guidance\\xa0Balance as of January 1, 2019Assets\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Prepaid expenses and other current assets\\xa0$1,765\\xa0$(17)\\xa0$1,748Property, plant and equipment  - net\\xa0$13,574\\xa0$(26)\\xa0$13,548Noncurrent deferred and refundable income taxes\\xa0$1,439\\xa0$(77)\\xa0$1,362Other assets\\xa0$2,332\\xa0$713\\xa0$3,045\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Liabilities\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Accrued expenses\\xa0$3,573\\xa0$(27)\\xa0$3,546Other current liabilities\\xa0$1,919\\xa0$209\\xa0$2,128\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Long-term debt due after one year\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Machinery, Energy & Transportation\\xa0$8,005\\xa0$(362)\\xa0$7,643Other liabilities\\xa0$3,756\\xa0$538\\xa0$4,294\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Shareholders’\\xa0equity\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Profit employed in the business\\xa0$30,427\\xa0$235\\xa0$30,662\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0We adopted the following ASUs effective January 1, 2019, none of which had a material impact on our financial statements:ASUDescription2017-08Premium amortization on purchased callable debt securities2017-12Derivatives and hedging - Targeted improvements2018-02Reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive incomeAccounting standards issued but not yet adoptedCredit losses (ASU 2016-13) – In June 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance to introduce a new model for recognizing credit losses on financial instruments based on an estimate of current expected credit losses.\\xa0 The new guidance will apply to loans, accounts receivable, trade receivables, other financial assets measured at amortized cost, loan commitments and other off-balance sheet credit exposures.\\xa0 The new guidance will also apply to debt securities and other financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.\\xa0 The new guidance was effective January 1, 2020.\\xa0 We do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements.77Table of ContentsWe consider the applicability and impact of all ASUs.  ASUs not listed above were assessed and either determined to be not applicable or not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.2. Sales and revenue recognitionA.   Sales of Machinery, Energy & TransportationSales of ME&T are recognized when all the following criteria are satisfied: (i) a contract with an independently owned and operated dealer or an end user exists which has commercial substance; (ii) it is probable we will collect the amount charged to the dealer or end user; and (iii) we have completed our performance obligation whereby the dealer or end user has obtained control of the product.  A contract with commercial substance exists once we receive and accept a purchase order under a dealer sales agreement, or once we enter into a contract with an end user.  If collectibility is not probable, the sale is deferred and not recognized until collection is probable or payment is received.  Control of our products typically transfers when title and risk of ownership of the product has transferred to the dealer or end user. Typically, where product is produced and sold in the same country, title and risk of ownership transfer when the product is shipped.  Products that are exported from a country for sale typically transfer title and risk of ownership at the border of the destination country. Our remanufacturing operations are primarily focused on the remanufacture of Cat engines and components and rail related products.\\xa0 In this business, used engines and related components (core) are inspected, cleaned and remanufactured.\\xa0 In connection with the sale of our remanufactured product to dealers, we collect a deposit that is repaid if the dealer returns an acceptable core within a specified time period.\\xa0 Caterpillar owns and has title to the cores when they are returned from dealers.\\xa0 The rebuilt engine or component (the core plus any new content) is then sold as a remanufactured product to dealers and end users.\\xa0 Revenue is recognized pursuant to the same transfer of control criteria as ME&T sales noted above.\\xa0 At the time of sale, the deposit is recognized in Other current liabilities in Statement 3, and the core to be returned is recognized as an asset in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in Statement 3 at the estimated replacement cost (based on historical experience with usable cores).\\xa0 Upon receipt of an acceptable core, we repay the deposit and relieve the liability.\\xa0 The returned core asset is then transferred into inventory.  In the event that the deposit is forfeited (i.e., upon failure by the dealer to return an acceptable core in the specified time period), we recognize the core deposit and the cost of the core in Sales and Cost of goods sold, respectively.\\xa0 We provide discounts to dealers through merchandising programs.  We have numerous programs that are designed to promote the sale of our products.\\xa0\\xa0The most common dealer programs provide a discount when the dealer sells a product to a targeted end user.\\xa0\\xa0Generally, the cost of these discounts is estimated for each product by model by geographic region based on historical experience and known changes in merchandising programs.  The cost of these discounts is reported as a reduction to the transaction price when the product sale is recognized.  A corresponding post-sale discount reserve is accrued in Statement 3, which represents discounts we expect to pay on units sold.  If discounts paid differ from those estimated, the difference is reported as a change in the transaction price.  Except for replacement parts, no right of return exists on the sale of our products.\\xa0\\xa0We estimate replacement part returns based on historical experience and recognize a parts return asset in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in Statement 3, which represents our right to recover replacement parts we expect will be returned.  We also recognize a refund liability in Other current liabilities in Statement 3 for the refund we expect to pay for returned parts.  If actual replacement part returns differ from those estimated, the difference in the estimated replacement part return asset and refund liability is recognized in Cost of goods sold and Sales, respectively.Our standard dealer invoice terms are established by marketing region. Our invoice terms for end user sales are established by the responsible business unit.  Payments from dealers are due shortly after the time of sale. When a sale is made to a dealer, the dealer is responsible for payment even if the product is not sold to an end user.  Dealers and end users must make payment within the established invoice terms to avoid potential interest costs. Interest at or above prevailing market rates may be charged on any past due balance, and generally our practice is to not forgive this interest.  In addition, Cat Financial provides wholesale inventory financing for a dealer’s purchase of inventory.  Wholesale inventory receivables have varying payment terms and are included in Receivables – trade and other and Long-term receivables – trade and other in Statement 3.  See Note 7 for further information.  Trade receivables from dealers and end users were $7,648 million, $7,743 million and $6,399 million as of December\\xa031, 2019, December\\xa031, 2018 and January\\xa01, 2018, respectively, and are recognized in Receivables – trade and other in Statement 3.  Long-term trade receivables from dealers and end users were $693 million, $674 million and $639 million as of December\\xa031, 2019, December\\xa031, 2018 and January\\xa01, 2018, respectively, and are recognized in Long-term receivables – trade and other in Statement 3.78Table of ContentsWe establish a bad debt allowance for ME&T receivables when it becomes probable that the receivable will not be collected.  Our allowance for bad debts is not significant.We invoice in advance of recognizing the sale of certain products.  We recognize advanced customer payments as a contract liability in Customer advances and Other liabilities in Statement 3.  Contract liabilities were $1,654 million, $1,680 million and $1,868 million as of December\\xa031, 2019, December\\xa031, 2018 and January\\xa01, 2018, respectively.  We reduce the contract liability when revenue is recognized.  During 2019, we recognized $1,171 million of revenue that was recorded as a contract liability at the beginning of 2019.  During 2018, we recognized $1,294 million of revenue that was recorded as a contract liability at the beginning of 2018.We have elected the practical expedient to not adjust the amount of revenue to be recognized under a contract with a dealer or end user for the effects of time value of money when the timing difference between receipt of payment and recognition of revenue is less than one year.As of December\\xa031, 2019, we have entered into contracts with dealers and end users for which sales have not been recognized as we have not satisfied our performance obligations and transferred control of the products.  The dollar amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original duration greater than one year is $6.2 billion, of which $2.4 billion is expected to be completed and revenue recognized in the twelve months following December\\xa031, 2019.  We have elected the practical expedient to not disclose unsatisfied performance obligations with an original contract duration of one year or less.  Contracts with an original duration of one year or less are primarily sales to dealers for machinery, engines and replacement parts.Sales and other related taxes are excluded from the transaction price.  Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in Cost of goods sold.  We provide a standard manufacturer’s warranty of our products at no additional cost.  At the time a sale is recognized, we record estimated future warranty costs.  See Note 21 for further discussion of our product warranty liabilities.See Note 23 for further disaggregated sales and revenues information.B.   Revenues of Financial ProductsRevenues of Financial Products are generated primarily from finance revenue on finance receivables and rental payments on operating leases.  Finance revenue is recorded over the life of the related finance receivable using the interest method, including the accretion of certain direct origination costs that are deferred.  Revenue from rental payments received on operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Recognition of finance revenue and rental revenue is suspended and the account is placed on non-accrual status when management determines that collection of future income is not probable (generally after 120 days past due).  Recognition is resumed, and previously suspended income is recognized, when the account becomes current and collection of remaining amounts is considered probable.  See Note 7 for more information.Revenues are presented net of sales and other related taxes. 3. Stock-based compensation\\xa0Our stock-based compensation plans primarily provide for the granting of stock options, stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance-based restricted stock units (PRSUs) to Officers and other key employees, as well as non-employee Directors. Stock options permit a holder to buy Caterpillar stock at the stock’s price when the option was granted. SARs permit a holder the right to receive the value in shares of the appreciation in Caterpillar stock that occurred from the date the right was granted up to the date of exercise.\\xa0\\xa0RSUs are agreements to issue shares of Caterpillar stock at the time of vesting.  PRSUs are similar to RSUs and include performance conditions in the vesting terms of the award. \\xa079Table of ContentsOur long-standing practices and policies specify that all stock-based compensation awards are approved by the Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors.\\xa0\\xa0The award approval process specifies the grant date, value and terms of the award.\\xa0\\xa0The same terms and conditions are consistently applied to all employee grants, including Officers. The Committee approves all individual Officer grants.\\xa0\\xa0The number of stock-based compensation award units\\xa0included in an individual’s award is determined based on the methodology approved by the Committee.\\xa0\\xa0The exercise price methodology approved by the Committee is the closing price of the Company stock on the date of the grant.  In June of 2014, shareholders approved the Caterpillar Inc. 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the Plan) under which all new stock-based compensation awards are granted.  In June of 2017, the Plan was amended and restated.  The Plan initially provided that up to 38,800,000 Common Shares would be reserved for future issuance under the Plan, subject to adjustment in certain events.  Subsequent to the shareholder approval of the amendment and restatement of the Plan, an additional 36,000,000 Common Shares became available for all awards under the Plan.\\xa0Common stock issued from Treasury stock under the plans totaled 5,126,379 for 2019, 5,590,641 for 2018 and 11,139,748 for 2017.  The total number of shares authorized for equity awards under the amended and restated Caterpillar Inc. 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan is 74,800,000, of which 40,754,720 shares remained available for issuance as of December 31, 2019.\\xa0Stock option and RSU awards generally vest according to a three-year graded vesting schedule.  One-third of the award will become vested on the first anniversary of the grant date, one-third of the award will become vested on the second anniversary of the grant date and one-third of the award will become vested on the third anniversary of the grant date.  PRSU awards generally have a three-year performance period and cliff vest at the end of the period based upon achievement of performance targets established at the time of grant.Upon separation from service, if the participant is 55 years of age or older with more than five years of service, the participant meets the criteria for a “Long Service Separation.”\\xa0 Award terms for stock option and RSU grants allow for continued vesting as of each vesting date specified in the award document for employees who meet the criteria for a “Long Service Separation” and fulfill a\\xa0requisite service period of six months.\\xa0 Compensation expense for eligible employees for the grants was recognized over the period from the grant date to the end date of the six-month requisite service period.\\xa0 For employees who become eligible for a “Long Service Separation” subsequent to the end date of the six-month requisite service period and prior to the completion of the vesting period, compensation expense is recognized over the period from the grant date to the date eligibility is achieved.\\xa0\\xa0For PRSU awards granted in 2018 and 2017, only a prorated number of shares may vest at the end of the performance period based upon achievement of the performance target, with the proration based upon the number of months of continuous employment during the three-year performance period.\\xa0 Employees with a “Long Service Separation” must also fulfill a six-month requisite service period in order to be eligible for the prorated vesting of outstanding PRSU awards granted in 2018 and 2017.\\xa0 Compensation expense for the 2018 and 2017 PRSU grants is being recognized on a straight-line basis over the three-year performance period for all participants.  Award terms for the 2019 PRSU grant allowed for continued vesting upon achievement of the performance target specified in the award document for employees who meet the criteria for a “Long Service Separation” and fulfill a requisite service period of six months. Compensation expense for the 2019 PRSU grant with respect to employees who have met the criteria for a “Long Service Separation” is recognized over the period from the grant date to the end of the six-month requisite service period. For employees who become eligible for a “Long Service Separation” subsequent to the end date of the six-month requisite service period and prior to the completion of the vesting period, compensation expense is recognized over the period from the grant date to the date eligibility is achieved. \\xa0At grant, option awards and SARs have a term life of ten years.\\xa0 For awards granted prior to 2016, if the “Long Service Separation” criteria are met, the vested options/SARs have a life that is the lesser of ten years from the original grant date or five years from the separation date.\\xa0 For awards granted beginning in 2016, the vested options have a life equal to ten years from the original grant date.Accounting guidance on share-based payments requires companies to estimate the fair value of options/SARs on the date of grant using an option-pricing model.\\xa0\\xa0The fair value of our option/SAR grants was estimated using a lattice-based option-pricing model.\\xa0\\xa0The lattice-based option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, risk-free interest rate and historical employee behavior.\\xa0\\xa0Expected volatility was based on historical Caterpillar stock price movement and current implied volatilities from traded options on Caterpillar stock. The risk-free interest rate was based on U.S. Treasury security yields at the time of grant.\\xa0\\xa0The weighted-average dividend yield was based on historical information.\\xa0\\xa0The expected life was determined from the lattice-based model. The lattice-based model incorporated exercise and post vesting forfeiture assumptions based on analysis of historical data. The following table provides the assumptions used in determining the fair value of the Option awards for the years ended December\\xa031, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.80Table of Contents\\xa0Grant\\xa0Year\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017Weighted-average dividend yield2.6%\\xa02.7%\\xa03.4%Weighted-average volatility29.1%\\xa030.2%\\xa029.2%Range of volatilities25.1-38.7%\\xa021.5-33.0%\\xa022.1-33.0%Range of risk-free interest rates2.48-2.68%\\xa02.02-2.87%\\xa00.81-2.35%Weighted-average expected lives7 years\\xa08 years\\xa08 years\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Beginning with the 2018 grant, RSU and PRSU awards are credited with dividend equivalent units on each date that a cash dividend is paid to holders of Common Stock. The fair value of the RSU and PRSU awards granted in 2019 and 2018 was determined as the closing stock price on the date of the grant. Prior to 2018, RSU and PRSU awards were not credited with dividend equivalent units and the fair value was determined by reducing the stock price on the date of the grant by the present value of the estimated dividends to be paid during the vesting period. The estimated dividends were based on Caterpillar’s quarterly divided per share at the time of the grant. 81Table of ContentsPlease refer to Tables I and II below for additional information on our stock-based compensation awards.\\xa0\\xa0TABLE I — Financial Information Related to Stock-based Compensation\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Stock options / SARs\\xa0RSUs\\xa0PRSUs\\xa0Shares\\xa0Weighted-\\xa0Average\\xa0Exercise\\xa0Price\\xa0Shares\\xa0Weighted-AverageGrant Date Fair Value\\xa0Shares\\xa0Weighted-AverageGrant Date Fair Value\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Outstanding at January 1, 201917,841,669\\xa0$91.93\\xa01,566,070\\xa0$112.99\\xa0735,299\\xa0$115.18Granted to officers and key employees 11,499,524\\xa0$138.35\\xa0687,294\\xa0$138.61\\xa0359,122\\xa0$138.67Exercised(4,808,237)\\xa0$83.81\\xa0—\\xa0$—\\xa0—\\xa0$—Vested—\\xa0$—\\xa0(820,927)\\xa0$99.76\\xa0(399,811)\\xa0$95.66Forfeited / expired(67,962)\\xa0$123.36\\xa0(63,234)\\xa0$133.39\\xa0(24,495)\\xa0$125.89Outstanding at December 31, 201914,464,994\\xa0$99.29\\xa01,369,203\\xa0$132.88\\xa0670,115\\xa0$144.46Exercisable at December 31, 201911,154,215\\xa0$89.84\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Stock options/SARs outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2019:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Outstanding\\xa0ExercisableExercise Prices\\xa0Shares Outstanding at 12/31/19\\xa0Weighted-\\xa0Average\\xa0Remaining\\xa0Contractual Life (Years)\\xa0Weighted-\\xa0Average\\xa0Exercise Price\\xa0Aggregate\\xa0Intrinsic Value 2\\xa0Shares Outstanding at 12/31/19\\xa0Weighted-\\xa0Average\\xa0RemainingContractual Life (Years)\\xa0Weighted-\\xa0Average\\xa0Exercise Price\\xa0Aggregate\\xa0Intrinsic Value 2$57.85-83.00\\xa05,775,829\\xa05.52\\xa0$78.64\\xa0$399\\xa05,775,829\\xa05.52\\xa0$78.64\\xa0$399$89.75-96.31\\xa04,680,238\\xa05.38\\xa0$94.56\\xa0249\\xa03,833,786\\xa04.96\\xa0$94.31\\xa0205$102.13-110.09\\xa01,052,650\\xa01.75\\xa0$106.48\\xa043\\xa01,052,650\\xa01.75\\xa0$106.48\\xa043$138.35-138.51\\xa01,496,071\\xa09.29\\xa0$138.35\\xa014\\xa05,119\\xa08.71\\xa0$138.51\\xa0—$141.32-151.12\\xa01,460,206\\xa08.30\\xa0$150.97\\xa0—\\xa0486,831\\xa08.30\\xa0$150.97\\xa0—\\xa0\\xa014,464,994\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$99.29\\xa0$705\\xa011,154,215\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$89.84\\xa0$6471\\xa0No SARs were granted during the year ended December\\xa031, 2019. 2\\xa0The difference between a stock award’s exercise price and the underlying stock’s closing market price at December\\xa031, 2019, for awards with market price greater than the exercise price.

Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for awards with terms that specify cliff or graded vesting and contain only service conditions.  Stock-based compensation expense for PRSUs is based on the probable number of shares expected to vest and is recognized primarily on a straight-line basis.  Before tax, stock-based compensation expense for 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $205 million, $197 million and $206 million, respectively, with a corresponding income tax benefit of $35 million, $36 million and $40 million, respectively. The amount of stock-based compensation expense capitalized for the years ended December\\xa031, 2019, 2018 and 2017 did not have a significant impact on our financial statements.\\xa0At December\\xa031, 2019, there was $161 million of total unrecognized compensation cost from stock-based compensation arrangements granted under the plans, which is related to non-vested stock-based awards.\\xa0\\xa0The compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.6 years.We currently use shares in treasury stock to satisfy share award exercises. \\xa0The cash tax benefits realized from stock awards exercised for 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $89 million, $103 million and $205 million, respectively. We use the direct only method and tax law ordering approach to calculate the tax effects of stock-based compensation.\\xa0\\xa0 4. Derivative financial instruments and risk management\\xa0Our earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.\\xa0\\xa0Our Risk Management Policy (policy) allows for the use of derivative financial instruments to prudently manage foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price exposures.\\xa0 Our policy specifies that derivatives are not to be used for speculative purposes.\\xa0\\xa0Derivatives that we use are primarily foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts, interest rate contracts and commodity forward and option contracts.\\xa0\\xa0Our derivative activities are subject to the management, direction and control of our senior financial officers.\\xa0\\xa0Risk management practices, including the use of financial derivative instruments, are presented to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors at least annually.\\xa083Table of ContentsAll derivatives are recognized in Statement 3 at their fair value. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, we designate the derivative as (1)\\xa0a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (fair value hedge), (2)\\xa0a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flow (cash flow hedge) or (3)\\xa0an undesignated instrument. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified, designated and highly effective as a fair value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the hedged recognized asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in current earnings. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified, designated and highly effective as a cash flow hedge are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI), to the extent effective, in Statement 3 until they are reclassified to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.\\xa0\\xa0Changes in the fair value of undesignated derivative instruments are reported in current earnings. Cash flows from designated derivative financial instruments are classified within the same category as the item being hedged on Statement 5.\\xa0\\xa0Cash flows from undesignated derivative financial instruments are included in the investing category on Statement 5.\\xa0We formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.\\xa0\\xa0This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges to specific assets and liabilities in Statement 3 and linking cash flow hedges to specific forecasted transactions or variability of cash flow.\\xa0We also formally assess, both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the designated derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flow of hedged items.\\xa0\\xa0When a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge or the underlying hedged transaction is no longer probable, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively, in accordance with the derecognition criteria for hedge accounting.\\xa0A.Foreign currency exchange rate risk\\xa0Foreign currency exchange rate movements create a degree of risk by affecting the U.S. dollar value of sales made and costs incurred in foreign currencies. Movements in foreign currency rates also affect our competitive position as these changes may affect business practices and/or pricing strategies of non-U.S.-based competitors. Additionally, we have balance sheet positions denominated in foreign currencies, thereby creating exposure to movements in exchange rates.\\xa0Our ME&T operations purchase, manufacture and sell products in many locations around the world. As we have a diversified revenue and cost base, we manage our future foreign currency cash flow exposure on a net basis. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow. Our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow. Our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to approximately five years.  As of December\\xa031, 2019, the maximum term of these outstanding contracts was approximately 60 months.\\xa0We generally designate as cash flow hedges at inception of the contract any Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Singapore dollar or Thailand baht forward or option contracts that meet the requirements for hedge accounting and the maturity extends beyond the current quarter-end. Designation is performed on a specific exposure basis to support hedge accounting. The remainder of ME&T foreign currency contracts are undesignated.\\xa0As of December\\xa031, 2019, $1 million of deferred net losses, net of tax, included in equity (AOCI in Statement 3), are expected to be reclassified to current earnings (Other income (expense) in Statement 1) over the next twelve months when earnings are affected by the hedged transactions.\\xa0\\xa0The actual amount recorded in Other income (expense) will vary based on exchange rates at the time the hedged transactions impact earnings.\\xa0In managing foreign currency risk for our Financial Products operations, our objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between our assets and liabilities and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency forward and option contracts are primarily undesignated.  We designate fixed-to-fixed cross currency contracts as cash flow hedges to protect against movements in exchange rates on foreign currency fixed-rate assets and liabilities.\\xa0B.Interest rate risk\\xa0Interest rate movements create a degree of risk by affecting the amount of our interest payments and the value of our fixed-rate debt. Our practice is to use interest rate contracts to manage our exposure to interest rate changes.84Table of Contents\\xa0Our ME&T operations generally use fixed-rate debt as a source of funding.\\xa0\\xa0Our objective is to minimize the cost of borrowed funds.\\xa0\\xa0Our policy allows us to enter into fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts and forward rate agreements to meet that objective. We designate fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts as fair value hedges at inception of the contract, and we designate certain forward rate agreements as cash flow hedges at inception of the contract.Financial Products operations has a match-funding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate and duration) of Cat Financial’s debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of our receivables portfolio within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis. In connection with that policy, we use interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the receivables portfolio. This matched funding reduces the volatility of margins between interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities, regardless of which direction interest rates move.\\xa0Our policy allows us to use fixed-to-floating, floating-to-fixed and floating-to-floating interest rate contracts to meet the match-funding objective.\\xa0\\xa0We designate fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts as fair value hedges to protect debt against changes in fair value due to changes in the benchmark interest rate.\\xa0\\xa0We designate most floating-to-fixed interest rate contracts as cash flow hedges to protect against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate.We have, at certain times, liquidated fixed-to-floating and floating-to-fixed interest rate contracts at both ME&T and Financial Products.\\xa0\\xa0The gains or losses associated with these contracts at the time of liquidation are amortized into earnings over the original term of the previously designated hedged item.\\xa0C.Commodity price risk\\xa0Commodity price movements create a degree of risk by affecting the price we must pay for certain raw materials. Our policy is to use commodity forward and option contracts to manage the commodity risk and reduce the cost of purchased materials.\\xa0Our ME&T operations purchase base and precious metals embedded in the components we purchase from suppliers.\\xa0\\xa0Our suppliers pass on to us price changes in the commodity portion of the component cost. In addition, we are subject to price changes on energy products such as natural gas and diesel fuel purchased for operational use.\\xa0Our objective is to minimize volatility in the price of these commodities. Our policy allows us to enter into commodity forward and option contracts to lock in the purchase price of a portion of these commodities within a five-year horizon. All such commodity forward and option contracts are undesignated.85Table of ContentsThe location and fair value of derivative instruments reported in Statement 3 are as follows:\\xa0\\xa0Consolidated\\xa0Statement of Financial Position Location\\xa0Asset\\xa0(Liability)\\xa0Fair\\xa0Value(Millions of dollars)\\xa0\\xa0Years\\xa0ended\\xa0December\\xa031,\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02019\\xa02018Designated derivatives\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Foreign exchange contracts\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Machinery, Energy & TransportationReceivables — trade and other\\xa0$18\\xa0$16Machinery, Energy & TransportationLong-term receivables — trade and other\\xa09\\xa0—Machinery, Energy & TransportationAccrued expenses\\xa0(20)\\xa0(26)Machinery, Energy & TransportationOther liabilities\\xa0—\\xa0(9)Financial ProductsReceivables — trade and other\\xa054\\xa053Financial ProductsLong-term receivables — trade and other\\xa013\\xa035Financial ProductsAccrued expenses\\xa0(3)\\xa0(9)Interest rate contracts\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Financial ProductsReceivables — trade and other\\xa0—\\xa01Financial ProductsLong-term receivables — trade and other\\xa05\\xa03Financial ProductsAccrued expenses\\xa0(25)\\xa0(40)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$51\\xa0$24\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Undesignated derivatives\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Foreign exchange contracts\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Machinery, Energy & TransportationReceivables — trade and other\\xa0$1\\xa0$2Machinery, Energy & TransportationAccrued expenses\\xa0—\\xa0(21)Financial ProductsReceivables — trade and other\\xa07\\xa015Financial ProductsLong-term receivables — trade and other\\xa05\\xa05Financial ProductsAccrued expenses\\xa0(22)\\xa0(14)Commodity contracts\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Machinery, Energy & TransportationReceivables — trade and other\\xa04\\xa01Machinery, Energy & TransportationAccrued expenses\\xa0(1)\\xa0(31)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$(6)\\xa0$(43)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The total notional amounts of the derivative instruments are as follows:\\xa0Years\\xa0ended\\xa0December\\xa031,(Millions of dollars)\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Machinery, Energy & Transportation\\xa0$2,563\\xa0$1,834Financial Products\\xa0$8,931\\xa0$10,210\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties.

Under these master netting agreements, net settlement generally permits the company or the counterparty to determine the net amount payable for contracts due on the same date and in the same currency for similar types of derivative transactions.  The master netting agreements generally also provide for net settlement of all outstanding contracts with a counterparty in the case of an event of default or a termination event.  Collateral is generally not required of the counterparties or of our company under the master netting agreements.  As of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, no cash collateral was received or pledged under the master netting agreements. 88Table of ContentsThe effect of the net settlement provisions of the master

local and U.S. taxes related to earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries, changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits associated with these earnings, losses at non-U.S. subsidiaries without local tax benefits due to valuation allowances and other permanent differences between tax and U.S. GAAP results.  Although not individually significant by jurisdiction, pre-tax permanent differences due to nondeductible net foreign exchange gains/losses of non-U.S. subsidiaries were approximately $36 million of net losses in 2019, $180 million of net losses in 2018 and $160 million of net gains in 2017.Included in the line item above labeled “Valuation allowances” are decreases in the valuation allowance for U.S. state deferred tax assets resulting in a $63 million non-cash benefit in 2018, net of federal deferred tax adjustment at 21 percent, compared to a $111 million non-cash benefit in 2017, net of federal deferred tax adjustment at 35 percent.  The primary driver of the decreases in the U.S. state valuation allowance was improved U.S. GAAP profits expected to recur in certain state jurisdictions.  90Table of ContentsAlso included in 2018 was a decrease in the valuation allowance for a non-U.S. subsidiary of $25 million offset by a charge of $59 million to correct for an error which resulted in an understatement of the valuation allowance offsetting deferred tax assets for prior years.  This error had the effect of overstating profit by $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.  Management has concluded that the error was not material to any period presented.  On December 22, 2017, U.S. tax legislation was enacted containing a broad range of tax reform provisions including a corporate tax rate reduction and changes in the U.S. taxation of non-U.S. earnings.  In 2018, measurement period adjustments of $104 million reduced the provisionally estimated charge of $2.371 billion recognized during the fourth quarter of 2017.  A $154 million benefit revised the estimated impact of the write-down of U.S. net deferred tax assets to reflect the reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent.  This benefit primarily related to the decision to make an additional discretionary pension contribution of $1.0 billion to U.S. pension plans in 2018 which was treated as deductible on the 2017 U.S. tax return.  A $50 million charge revised the estimated cost of a mandatory deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings, including changes in the deferred tax liability related to the amount of earnings considered not indefinitely reinvested as well as the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and state tax liabilities associated with these tax positions.  During 2019, a $178 million tax benefit was recorded to adjust previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of receipt of additional guidance related to the calculation of the mandatory deemed repatriation of non-U.S. earnings.  As a result of U.S. tax reform legislation, distributions of profits from non-U.S. subsidiaries are not expected to cause a significant incremental U.S. tax impact in the future.  However, these distributions may be subject to non-U.S. withholding taxes if profits are distributed from certain jurisdictions.  Undistributed profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries of approximately $14 billion are considered indefinitely reinvested.  Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to indefinitely reinvested profits is not feasible primarily due to our legal entity structure and the complexity of U.S. and local tax laws.The components of profit (loss) before taxes were:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Years\\xa0ended\\xa0December\\xa031,(Millions\\xa0of\\xa0dollars)\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017U.S.\\xa0$2,888\\xa0$2,131\\xa0$240Non-U.S.\\xa04,924\\xa05,691\\xa03,842\\xa0\\xa0$7,812\\xa0$7,822\\xa0$4,082\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Profit before taxes, as shown above, is based on the location of the entity to which such earnings are attributable.

The total amount of interest and penalties accrued was $233 million and $190 million as of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\\xa0On January 31, 2018, we received a Revenue Agent’s Report from the IRS indicating the end of the field examination of our U.S. income tax returns for 2010 to 2012.  In the audits of 2007 to 2012 including the impact of a loss carryback to 2005, the IRS has proposed to tax in the United States profits earned from certain parts transactions by Caterpillar SARL (CSARL), based on the IRS examination team’s application of the “substance-over-form” or “assignment-of-income” judicial doctrines.  We are vigorously contesting the proposed increases to tax and penalties for these years of approximately $2.3 billion.  We believe that the relevant transactions complied with applicable tax laws and did not violate judicial doctrines.  We have filed U.S. income tax returns on this same basis for years after 2012.  Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant change to our unrecognized tax benefits for this position within the next 12 months.  We currently believe the ultimate disposition of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations.With the exception of a loss carryback to 2005, tax years prior to 2007 are generally no longer subject to U.S. tax assessment.  In our major non-U.S. jurisdictions including Australia, Brazil, China, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, Switzerland, Singapore and the U.K., tax years are typically subject to examination for three to ten years.  Due to the uncertainty related to the timing and potential outcome of audits, we cannot estimate the range of reasonably possible change in unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. 7.

Accordingly, this presentation should not be regarded as a forecast of future cash collections.Please refer to Note\\xa018 and Table\\xa0III for fair value information.95\\xa0C.Allowance for credit losses\\xa0The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the losses inherent in Cat Financial’s finance receivable portfolio and includes consideration of accounts that have been individually identified as impaired, as well as pools of finance receivables where it is probable that certain receivables in the pool are impaired but the individual accounts cannot yet be identified. \\xa0 In identifying and measuring impairment, management takes into consideration past loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, estimated value of underlying collateral and current economic conditions.\\xa0\\xa0Accounts are identified for individual review based on past-due status and information available about the customer, such as financial statements, news reports and published credit ratings, as well as general information regarding industry trends and the economic environment in which Cat Financial’s customers operate. The allowance for credit losses attributable to finance receivables that are individually evaluated and determined to be impaired is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables’ effective interest rate, the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent receivables or the observable market price of the receivable.\\xa0\\xa0In determining collateral value, Cat Financial estimates the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs.  Cat Financial also considers credit enhancements such as additional collateral and contractual third-party guarantees. The allowance for credit losses attributable to the remaining accounts not yet individually identified as impaired is estimated based on loss forecast models utilizing probabilities of default, our estimate of the loss emergence period and the estimated loss given default.\\xa0\\xa0In addition, qualitative factors not able to be fully captured in the loss forecast models including industry trends, macroeconomic factors and model imprecision are considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses.\\xa0\\xa0These qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment.Cat Financial’s allowance for credit losses is segregated into two portfolio segments:\\xa0•Customer - Finance receivables with end-user customers.•Dealer - Finance receivables with Caterpillar dealers.A portfolio segment is the level at which the Company develops a systematic methodology for determining its allowance for credit losses.\\xa0Cat Financial further evaluates portfolio segments by the class of finance receivables, which is defined as a level of information (below a portfolio segment) in which the finance receivables have the same initial measurement attribute and a similar method for assessing and monitoring credit risk.\\xa0 Typically, Cat Financial’s finance receivables within a geographic area have similar credit risk profiles and methods for assessing and monitoring credit risk.\\xa0 Cat Financial’s classes, which align with management reporting for credit losses, are as follows:\\xa0•North America - Finance receivables originated in the United States and Canada.•EAME - Finance receivables originated in Europe, Africa, Middle East and the Commonwealth of Independent States.•Asia Pacific - Finance receivables originated in Australia, New Zealand, China, Japan, Southeast Asia and India.•Mining - Finance receivables related to large mining customers worldwide.•Latin America - Finance receivables originated in Mexico and Central and South American countries.•Caterpillar Power Finance - Finance receivables originated worldwide related to marine vessels with Caterpillar engines and Caterpillar electrical power generation, gas compression and co-generation systems and non-Caterpillar equipment that is powered by these systems.96Table of ContentsAn analysis of the allowance for credit losses was as follows:(Millions of dollars)\\xa0December\\xa031, 2019\\xa0\\xa0Customer\\xa0Dealer\\xa0TotalAllowance for Credit Losses:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Balance at beginning of year\\xa0$486\\xa0$21\\xa0$507Receivables written off\\xa0(281)\\xa0—\\xa0(281)Recoveries on receivables previously written off\\xa044\\xa0—\\xa044Provision for credit losses\\xa0138\\xa024\\xa0162Other\\xa0(12)\\xa0—\\xa0(12)Balance at end of year\\xa0$375\\xa0$45\\xa0$420\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Individually evaluated for impairment\\xa0$178\\xa0$39\\xa0$217Collectively evaluated for impairment\\xa0197\\xa06\\xa0203Ending Balance\\xa0$375\\xa0$45\\xa0$420\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Recorded Investment in Finance Receivables:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Individually evaluated for impairment\\xa0$594\\xa0$78\\xa0$672Collectively evaluated for impairment\\xa018,093\\xa03,632\\xa021,725Ending Balance\\xa0$18,687\\xa0$3,710\\xa0$22,397\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(Millions of dollars)\\xa0December\\xa031, 2018\\xa0\\xa0Customer\\xa0Dealer\\xa0TotalAllowance for Credit Losses:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Balance at beginning of year\\xa0$353\\xa0$9\\xa0$362Receivables written off\\xa0(235)\\xa0—\\xa0(235)Recoveries on receivables previously written off\\xa046\\xa0—\\xa046Provision for credit losses\\xa0337\\xa012\\xa0349Other\\xa0(15)\\xa0—\\xa0(15)Balance at end of year\\xa0$486\\xa0$21\\xa0$507\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Individually evaluated for impairment\\xa0$288\\xa0$14\\xa0$302Collectively evaluated for impairment\\xa0198\\xa07\\xa0205Ending Balance\\xa0$486\\xa0$21\\xa0$507\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Recorded Investment in Finance Receivables:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Individually evaluated for impairment\\xa0$858\\xa0$78\\xa0$936Collectively evaluated for impairment\\xa018,152\\xa03,338\\xa021,490Ending Balance\\xa0$19,010\\xa0$3,416\\xa0$22,426\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Credit quality of finance receivables\\xa0At origination, Cat Financial evaluates credit risk based on a variety of credit quality factors including prior payment experience, customer financial information, credit-rating agency ratings, loan-to-value ratios and other internal metrics. On an ongoing basis, Cat Financial monitors credit quality based on past-due status and collection experience as there is a meaningful correlation between the past-due status of customers and the risk of loss. 97Table of ContentsIn determining past-due status, Cat Financial considers the entire recorded investment in finance receivable past due when any installment is over 30 days past due.

Our defined benefit pension plans provide a benefit based on years of service and/or the employee’s average earnings near retirement.  Our defined contribution plans allow employees to contribute a portion of their salary to help save for retirement, and in most cases, we provide a matching contribution.  The benefit obligation related to our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are for employees located primarily in Europe, Japan and Brazil.  For other postretirement benefits (OPEB), substantially all of our benefit obligation is for employees located in the United States. \\xa0Our U.S. defined benefit pension plans for support and management employees were frozen for certain employees on December 31, 2010 and were frozen for the remaining employees on December 31, 2019.  On the respective transition dates employees move to a retirement benefit that provides a frozen pension benefit and a 401(k) plan that will include a matching contribution and a new annual employer contribution.  In the first quarter of 2017, we announced the closure of our Gosselies, Belgium facility.  This announcement impacted certain employees that participated in a defined benefit pension plan and resulted in a net loss of $20 million in the first quarter of 2017 for curtailment and termination benefits. All curtailments and termination benefits were recognized in Other income (expense) in Statement 1. A.

This rate is sensitive to changes in interest rates.

Plan assetsIn general, our strategy for both the U.S. and non-U.S. pensions includes ongoing alignment of our investments to our liabilities, while reducing risk in our portfolio.  The current U.S. pension target asset allocation is 70 percent fixed income and 30 percent equities.  This target allocation will be revisited periodically to ensure it reflects our overall objectives.  The non-U.S. pension weighted-average target allocations are 79 percent fixed income, 12 percent equities, 5 percent real estate and 4 percent other.\\xa0 The target allocations for each plan vary based upon local statutory requirements, demographics of plan participants and funded status.\\xa0 The non-U.S. plan assets are primarily invested in non-U.S. securities.\\xa0Our target allocation for the other postretirement benefit plans is 70 percent equities and 30 percent fixed income.\\xa0 \\xa0The U.S. plans are rebalanced to within the appropriate target asset allocation ranges on a monthly basis.\\xa0 The frequency of rebalancing for the non-U.S. plans varies depending on the plan.  As a result of our diversification strategies, there are no significant concentrations of risk within the portfolio of investments.112Table of Contents\\xa0The use of certain derivative instruments is permitted where appropriate and necessary for achieving overall investment policy objectives. \\xa0The plans do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes.\\xa0The accounting guidance on fair value measurements specifies a fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques (Level 1, 2 and 3).\\xa0 See Note 18 for a discussion of the fair value hierarchy.\\xa0Fair values are determined as follows:\\xa0•Equity securities are primarily based on valuations for identical instruments in active markets.•Fixed income securities are primarily based upon models that take into consideration such market-based factors as recent sales, risk-free yield curves and prices of similarly rated bonds.•Real estate is stated at the fund’s net asset value or at appraised value.•Cash, short-term instruments and other are based on the carrying amount, which approximates fair value, or the fund’s net asset value.The fair value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by category is summarized below:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0December\\xa031, 2019(Millions\\xa0of\\xa0dollars)\\xa0Level\\xa01\\xa0Level\\xa02\\xa0Level\\xa03\\xa0Measured at

Defined contribution plans\\xa0We have both U.S. and non-U.S. employee defined contribution plans to help employees save for retirement.  Our primary U.S. 401(k) plan allows eligible employees to contribute a portion of their cash compensation to the plan on a tax-deferred basis.  Employees with frozen defined benefit pension accruals are eligible for matching contributions equal to 100 percent of employee contributions to the plan up to 6 percent of cash compensation and an annual employer contribution that ranges from 3 to 5 percent of cash compensation (depending on years of service and age).  Employees that were still accruing benefits under a defined benefit pension plan up to December 31, 2019 were eligible for matching contributions equal to 50 percent of employee contributions up to 6 percent of cash compensation.  All our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were frozen on December 31, 2019 for remaining employees still accruing a benefit.  Starting in 2020, these employees will receive matching contributions equal to 100 percent of employee contributions to the plan up to 6 percent of cash compensation and an annual employer contribution that ranges from 3 to 5 percent of cash compensation (depending on years of service and age).116These 401(k) plans include various investment funds, including a non-leveraged employee stock ownership plan (ESOP).  As of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, the ESOP held 14.9 million and 17.2 million shares, respectively.  All of the shares held by the ESOP were allocated to participant accounts.  Dividends paid to participants are automatically reinvested into company shares unless the participant elects to have all or a portion of the dividend paid to the participant.  Various other U.S. and non-U.S. defined contribution plans generally allow eligible employees to contribute a portion of their cash compensation to the plans, and in most cases, we provide a matching contribution to the funds.\\xa0Total company costs related to U.S. and non-U.S. defined contribution plans were as follows:\\xa0(Millions\\xa0of\\xa0dollars)\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017U.S. plans\\xa0$414\\xa0$271\\xa0$375Non-U.S. plans\\xa083\\xa089\\xa073\\xa0\\xa0$497\\xa0$360\\xa0$448\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa013.Short-term borrowings\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0December\\xa031,(Millions\\xa0of\\xa0dollars)\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa0Machinery, Energy & Transportation:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Notes payable to banks\\xa0$5\\xa0$—\\xa0\\xa0\\xa05\\xa0—\\xa0Financial Products:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Notes payable to banks\\xa0605\\xa0526\\xa0Commercial paper\\xa04,168\\xa04,759\\xa0Demand notes\\xa0388\\xa0438\\xa0\\xa0\\xa05,161\\xa05,723\\xa0Total short-term borrowings\\xa0$5,166\\xa0$5,723\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The weighted-average interest rates on short-term borrowings outstanding were:\\xa0\\xa0December\\xa031,\\xa0\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa0Notes payable to banks\\xa05.0%\\xa05.3%\\xa0Commercial paper\\xa01.3%\\xa02.0%\\xa0Demand notes\\xa01.7%\\xa02.2%\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Please refer to Note 18 and Table III for fair value information on short-term borrowings.117Table of Contents14.

Information on our Credit Facility is as follows: \\xa0•The 364-day facility of $3.15 billion (of which $0.82 billion is available to ME&T) expires in September 2020.•The three-year facility, as amended and restated in September 2019, of $2.73 billion (of which $0.72 billion is available to ME&T) expires in September 2022.•The five-year facility, as amended and restated in September 2019, of $4.62 billion (of which $1.21 billion is available to ME&T) expires in September 2024.Other consolidated credit lines with banks as of December\\xa031, 2019 totaled $5.00 billion. These committed and uncommitted credit lines, which may be eligible for renewal at various future dates or have no specified expiration date, are used primarily by our subsidiaries for local funding requirements.\\xa0\\xa0Caterpillar or Cat Financial may guarantee subsidiary borrowings under these lines.119Table of ContentsAt December\\xa031, 2019, Caterpillar’s consolidated net worth was $14.63 billion, which was above the $9.00 billion required under the Credit Facility.\\xa0 The consolidated net worth is defined as the consolidated shareholders’ equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).At December\\xa031, 2019, Cat Financial’s covenant interest coverage ratio was 1.77 to 1.\\xa0 This is above the 1.15 to 1 minimum ratio, calculated as (1)\\xa0profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to (2)\\xa0interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended, required by the Credit Facility.In addition, at December\\xa031, 2019, Cat Financial’s six-month covenant leverage ratio was 7.65 to 1 and year-end covenant leverage ratio was 7.46 to 1.\\xa0 This is below the maximum ratio of debt to net worth of 10 to 1, calculated (1)\\xa0on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2)\\xa0at each December\\xa031, required by the Credit Facility.In the event Caterpillar or Cat Financial does not meet one or more of their respective financial covenants under the Credit Facility in the future (and are unable to obtain a consent or waiver), the syndicate of banks may terminate the commitments allocated to the party that does not meet its covenants.\\xa0 Additionally, in such event, certain of Cat Financial’s other lenders under other loan agreements where similar financial covenants or cross default provisions are applicable may, at their election, choose to pursue remedies under those loan agreements, including accelerating the repayment of outstanding borrowings.\\xa0 At December\\xa031, 2019, there were no borrowings under the Credit Facility.\\xa016.Profit per share\\xa0Computations of profit per share:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(Dollars\\xa0in\\xa0millions\\xa0except\\xa0per\\xa0share\\xa0data)\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017Profit for the period (A)\\xa01\\xa0\\xa0$6,093\\xa0$6,147\\xa0$754Determination of shares (in millions):\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Weighted average number of common shares outstanding (B)\\xa0561.6\\xa0591.4\\xa0591.8Shares issuable on exercise of stock awards, net of shares assumed to be purchased out of proceeds at average market price\\xa05.9\\xa08.0\\xa07.5Average common shares outstanding for fully diluted computation (C) 2\\xa0567.5\\xa0599.4\\xa0599.3Profit per share of common stock:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Assuming no dilution (A/B)\\xa0$10.85\\xa0$10.39\\xa0$1.27Assuming full dilution (A/C) 2\\xa0$10.74\\xa0$10.26\\xa0$1.26Shares outstanding as of December\\xa031 (in millions)\\xa0550.1\\xa0575.5\\xa0597.61\\xa0Profit attributable to common shareholders.2\\xa0Diluted by assumed exercise of stock-based compensation awards using the treasury stock method.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, 3.0 million and 1.5 million outstanding stock options, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect would have been antidilutive.  For 2017, no outstanding SARs and stock options were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because all outstanding SARs and stock options had a dilutive effect.In July 2018, the Board approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to $10.0 billion of Caterpillar common stock effective January 1, 2019, with no expiration.During 2019 and 2018, we repurchased 30.6 million  and 27.7 million shares of Caterpillar common stock, respectively, at an aggregate cost of $4.0 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively.

as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.\\xa0\\xa0This guidance also specifies a fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques.\\xa0\\xa0Observable inputs (highest level) reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs (lowest level) reflect internally developed market assumptions.\\xa0\\xa0In accordance with this guidance, fair value measurements are classified under the following hierarchy:\\xa0•Level 1 –\\xa0Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.•Level 2 – Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or significant value-drivers are observable in active markets.•Level 3 – Model-derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or significant value-drivers are unobservable.\\xa0When available, we use quoted market prices to determine fair value, and we classify such measurements within Level 1.\\xa0\\xa0In some cases where market prices are not available, we make use of observable market based inputs to calculate fair value, in which case the measurements are classified within Level 2.\\xa0\\xa0If quoted or observable market prices are not available, fair value is based upon valuations in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable, including internally developed models that use, where possible, current market-based parameters such as interest rates, yield curves and currency rates.\\xa0\\xa0These measurements are classified within Level 3.Fair value measurements are classified according to the lowest level input or value-driver that is significant to the valuation.\\xa0\\xa0A measurement may therefore be classified within Level 3 even though there may be significant inputs that are readily observable.\\xa0Fair value measurement includes the consideration of nonperformance risk.\\xa0\\xa0Nonperformance risk refers to the risk that an obligation (either by a counterparty or Caterpillar) will not be fulfilled.\\xa0\\xa0For financial assets traded in an active market (Level 1 and certain Level 2), the nonperformance risk is included in the market price.\\xa0\\xa0For certain other financial assets and liabilities (certain Level 2 and Level 3), our fair value calculations have been adjusted accordingly.\\xa0Investments in debt and equity securitiesWe have investments in certain debt and equity securities, primarily at Insurance Services, that are recorded at fair value.\\xa0\\xa0Fair values for our U.S. treasury bonds and large capitalization value and smaller company growth equity securities are based upon valuations for identical instruments in active markets.\\xa0\\xa0Fair values for other government bonds, corporate bonds and mortgage-backed debt securities are based upon models that take into consideration such market-based factors as recent sales, risk-free yield curves and prices of similarly rated bonds.\\xa0In addition, Insurance Services has an equity investment in a real estate investment trust (REIT) which is recorded at fair value based on the net asset value (NAV) of the investment and is not classified within the fair value hierarchy.See Note 11 for additional information on our investments in debt and equity securities.\\xa0Derivative financial instrumentsThe fair value of interest rate contracts is primarily based on models that utilize the appropriate market-based forward swap curves and zero-coupon interest rates to determine discounted cash flows.\\xa0\\xa0The fair value of foreign currency and commodity forward, option and cross currency contracts is based on a valuation model that discounts cash flows resulting from the differential between the contract price and the market-based forward rate.123Table of ContentsAssets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis at fair value, primarily related to Financial Products, included in Statement 3 as of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018 are summarized below:\\xa0\\xa0December\\xa031,

A loan is considered impaired when management determines that collection of contractual amounts due is not probable.\\xa0\\xa0In these cases, an allowance for credit losses may be established based either on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables’ effective interest rate, the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent receivables, or the observable market price of the receivable.\\xa0 In determining collateral value, Cat Financial estimates the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs.  Cat Financial had impaired loans with a fair value of $343 million and $469 million for the years ended December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0B.Fair values of financial instruments\\xa0In addition to the methods and assumptions we use to record the fair value of financial instruments as discussed in the Fair value measurements section above, we used the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value of our financial instruments:\\xa0Cash and short-term investmentsCarrying amount approximated fair value.\\xa0Restricted cash and short-term investmentsCarrying amount approximated fair value.\\xa0 Restricted cash and short-term investments are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in Statement 3.\\xa0125Table of ContentsFinance receivablesFair value was estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current rates, representative of receivables with similar remaining maturities.\\xa0Wholesale inventory receivablesFair value was estimated by discounting the future cash flows using current rates, representative of receivables with similar remaining maturities.\\xa0Short-term borrowingsCarrying amount approximated fair value.\\xa0Long-term debtFair value for fixed and floating rate debt was estimated based on quoted market prices.GuaranteesThe fair value of guarantees is based upon our estimate of the premium a market participant would require to issue the same guarantee in a stand-alone arms-length transaction with an unrelated party.  If quoted or observable market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that utilize current market-based assumptions.\\xa0Fair values of our financial instruments were as follows:\\xa0TABLE III—Fair Values of Financial Instruments\\xa0\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(Millions\\xa0of\\xa0dollars)\\xa0CarryingAmount\\xa0FairValue\\xa0CarryingAmount\\xa0FairValue\\xa0Fair Value Levels\\xa0ReferenceAssets at December\\xa031,\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Cash and short-term investments\\xa0$8,284\\xa0$8,284\\xa0$7,857\\xa0$7,857\\xa01\\xa0Statement 3Restricted cash and short-term investments\\xa08\\xa08\\xa033\\xa033\\xa01\\xa0Statement 3Investments in debt and equity securities\\xa01,711\\xa01,711\\xa01,576\\xa01,576\\xa01, 2 & 3\\xa0Notes 11\\xa0& 19Finance receivables–net (excluding finance leases 1)\\xa014,473\\xa014,613\\xa014,714\\xa014,798\\xa03\\xa0Notes 7 & 19Wholesale inventory receivables–net (excluding finance leases 1)\\xa01,105\\xa01,076\\xa01,050\\xa01,025\\xa03\\xa0Notes 7 & 19Foreign currency contracts–net\\xa062\\xa062\\xa047\\xa047\\xa02\\xa0Notes 4\\xa0& 19Commodity contracts–net\\xa03\\xa03\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa02\\xa0Notes 4 & 19\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Liabilities at December\\xa031,\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Short-term borrowings\\xa05,166\\xa05,166\\xa05,723\\xa05,723\\xa01\\xa0Note 13Long-term debt (including amounts due within one year):\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Machinery, Energy & Transportation\\xa09,157\\xa011,216\\xa08,015\\xa09,046\\xa02\\xa0Note 14Financial Products\\xa023,334\\xa023,655\\xa022,815\\xa022,684\\xa02\\xa0Note 14Interest rate swaps–net\\xa020\\xa020\\xa036\\xa036\\xa02\\xa0Notes 4 & 19Commodity contracts–net\\xa0—\\xa0—\\xa030\\xa030\\xa02\\xa0Notes 4 & 19Guarantees\\xa05\\xa05\\xa08\\xa08\\xa03\\xa0Note 21\\xa01\\xa0Represents finance leases and failed sale leasebacks of $7,800 million at December\\xa031, 2019 and finance leases of $7,463 million at December 31, 2018, respectively.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa019.Concentration of credit risk\\xa0Financial instruments with potential credit risk consist primarily of trade and finance receivables and short-term and long-term investments.  Additionally, to a lesser extent, we have a potential credit risk associated with counterparties to derivative contracts.\\xa0126Table of ContentsTrade receivables are primarily short-term receivables from independently owned and operated dealers and customers which arise in the normal course of business.  We perform regular credit evaluations of our dealers and customers.  Collateral generally is not required, and the majority of our trade receivables are unsecured.  We do, however, when deemed necessary, make use of various devices such as security agreements and letters of credit to protect our interests.  No single dealer or customer represents a significant concentration of credit risk.\\xa0Finance receivables and wholesale inventory receivables primarily represent receivables under installment sales contracts, receivables arising from leasing transactions and notes receivable.  We generally maintain a secured interest in the equipment financed.  No single customer or dealer represents a significant concentration of credit risk.\\xa0Short-term and long-term investments are held with high quality institutions and, by policy, the amount of credit exposure to any one institution is limited.  Long-term investments, primarily included in Other assets in Statement 3, are comprised primarily of available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities at Insurance Services.\\xa0For derivative contracts, collateral is generally not required of the counterparties or of our company.\\xa0\\xa0The company generally enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreements within ME&T and Financial Products that permit the net settlement of amounts owed under their respective derivative contracts.\\xa0\\xa0Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties is limited to only those gains that we have recorded, but for which we have not yet received cash payment.  The master netting agreements reduce the amount of loss the company would incur should the counterparties fail to meet their obligations.\\xa0\\xa0At December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, the maximum exposure to credit loss was $116 million and $131 million, respectively, before the application of any master netting agreements.\\xa0\\xa0Please refer to Note 18 and Table III above for fair value information.\\xa020.Leases\\xa0A.  Lessee arrangementsWe lease certain property, information technology equipment, warehouse equipment, vehicles and other equipment through operating leases.  We recognize a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset based on the present value of lease payments.  To determine the present value of lease payments for most of our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on information available on the lease commencement date. For certain property and information technology equipment leases, we have elected to separate payments for lease components from non-lease components. For all other leases, we have elected not to separate payments for lease and non-lease components.  Our lease agreements may include options to extend or terminate the lease.  When it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option, we have included the option in the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.  We have elected not to recognize right-of-use assets or lease liabilities for leases with a term of twelve months or less.Our finance leases are not significant and therefore are not included in the following disclosures. The components of lease costs were as follows:  \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(Millions of dollars)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Year ended December 31\\xa0\\xa02019Operating lease cost\\xa0$232Short-term lease cost\\xa0$57\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Operating lease right-of-use assets are recognized in Other assets in Statement 3.

Lessor arrangementsWe lease Caterpillar machinery, engines and other equipment to customers and dealers around the world, primarily through Cat Financial.  Cat Financial leases to customers primarily through sales-type (non-tax) leases, where the lessee for tax purposes is considered to be the owner of the equipment during the term of the lease.  Cat Financial also offers tax leases that are classified as either operating or direct finance leases for financial accounting purposes, depending on the characteristics of the lease. For tax purposes, Cat Financial is considered the owner of the equipment. Our lease agreements may include options for the lessee to purchase the underlying asset at the end of the lease term for either a stated fixed price or fair market value.  The residual value of Cat Financial’s leased equipment is determined based on its estimated end-of-term market value.\\xa0 We estimate the residual value of leased equipment at the inception of the lease based on a number of factors, including historical wholesale market sales prices, past remarketing experience and any known significant market/product trends.\\xa0 The following critical factors are also considered in our residual value estimates: lease term, market size and demand, total expected hours of usage, machine configuration, application, location, model changes, quantities, third-party residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options.During the term of our leases, we monitor residual values.\\xa0 For operating leases, adjustments to depreciation expense reflecting changes in residual value estimates are recorded prospectively on a straight-line basis.\\xa0 For finance leases, residual value adjustments are recognized through a reduction of finance revenue over the remaining lease term.See Note 7 for contractual maturities of finance lease receivables (sales-type and direct finance leases). The carrying amount of equipment leased to others, included in Property, plant and equipment - net in Statement 3, under operating leases was as follows:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0December 31,(Millions of dollars)\\xa02019\\xa02018Equipment leased to others - at original cost\\xa0$6,208\\xa0$6,015Less: Accumulated depreciation\\xa0(1,960)\\xa0(1,744)Equipment leased to others - net\\xa0$4,248\\xa0$4,271\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0129Payments due for operating leases at December\\xa031, 2019 and scheduled minimum rental payments for operating leases at December 31, 2018 were as follows:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(Millions of dollars)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0December\\xa031, 2019\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02020\\xa02021\\xa02022\\xa02023\\xa02024\\xa0Thereafter\\xa0Total$861\\xa0$558\\xa0$299\\xa0$149\\xa0$74\\xa0$70\\xa0$2,011\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0December 31, 2018\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02019\\xa02020\\xa02021\\xa02022\\xa02023\\xa0Thereafter\\xa0Total$896\\xa0$574\\xa0$314\\xa0$158\\xa0$71\\xa0$69\\xa0$2,082\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Revenues from finance and operating leases, primarily included in Revenues of Financial Products on Statement 1, were as follows:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(Millions of dollars)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Year ended December 31\\xa0\\xa02019Finance lease revenue\\xa0\\xa0$521Operating lease revenue\\xa0\\xa01,248Total\\xa0\\xa0$1,769\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Revenues are presented net of sales and other related taxes.  \\xa021.Guarantees and product warranty\\xa0Caterpillar dealer performance guaranteesWe have provided an indemnity to a third-party insurance company for potential losses related to performance bonds issued on behalf of Caterpillar dealers.\\xa0\\xa0The bonds have varying terms and are issued to insure governmental agencies against nonperformance by certain dealers.\\xa0\\xa0We also provided guarantees to third-parties related to the performance of contractual obligations by certain Caterpillar dealers.  These guarantees have varying terms and cover potential financial losses incurred by the third parties resulting from the dealers’ nonperformance.  In 2016, we provided a guarantee to an end user related to the performance of contractual obligations by a Caterpillar dealer.  Under the guarantee, which expires in 2025, non-performance by the Caterpillar dealer could require Caterpillar to satisfy the contractual obligations by providing goods, services or financial compensation to the end user up to an annual designated cap. Supplier consortium performance guaranteesWe have provided guarantees to a customer in Brazil and a customer in Europe related to the performance of contractual obligations by supplier consortiums to which our Caterpillar subsidiaries are members.  The guarantees cover potential damages incurred by the customers resulting from the supplier consortiums’ non-performance.  The damages are capped except for failure of the consortiums to meet certain obligations outlined in the contract in the normal course of business.  The guarantee for the customer in Europe will expire when the supplier consortium performs all of its contractual obligations, which are expected to be completed in 2022. The agreement with the customer in Brazil was terminated during second quarter of 2019.  No payments were made under the guarantee.  We have dealer performance guarantees and third-party performance guarantees that do not limit potential payment to end users related to indemnities and other commercial contractual obligations.  In addition, we have entered into contracts involving industry standard indemnifications that do not limit potential payment.  For these unlimited guarantees, we are unable to estimate a maximum potential amount of future payments that could result from claims made.130Table of ContentsNo significant loss has been experienced or is anticipated under any of these guarantees.  At December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, the related recorded liability was $5 million and $8 million, respectively.  The maximum potential amount of future payments (undiscounted and without reduction for any amounts that may possibly be recovered under recourse or collateralized provisions) we could be required to make under the guarantees at December\\xa031 are as follows:\\xa0(Millions\\xa0of\\xa0dollars)\\xa02019\\xa02018Caterpillar dealer performance guarantees\\xa0$1,150\\xa0$1,244Supplier consortium performance guarantees\\xa0238\\xa0527Other guarantees\\xa0221\\xa0207Total guarantees\\xa0$1,609\\xa0$1,978\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Cat Financial provides guarantees to repurchase certain loans of Caterpillar dealers from a special-purpose corporation (SPC) that qualifies as a variable interest entity.\\xa0 The purpose of the SPC is to provide short-term working capital loans to Caterpillar dealers.\\xa0 This SPC issues commercial paper and uses the proceeds to fund its loan program.\\xa0 Cat Financial has a loan purchase agreement with the SPC that obligates Cat Financial to purchase certain loans that are not paid at maturity.\\xa0 Cat Financial receives a fee for providing this guarantee, which provides a source of liquidity for the SPC.\\xa0 Cat Financial is the primary beneficiary of the SPC as its guarantees result in Cat Financial having both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the SPC’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses, and therefore Cat Financial has consolidated the financial statements of the SPC.\\xa0 As of December\\xa031, 2019 and 2018, the SPC’s assets of $1,453 million and $1,149 million, respectively, were primarily comprised of loans to dealers, and the SPC’s liabilities of $1,452 million and $1,148 million, respectively, were primarily comprised of commercial paper.\\xa0 The assets of the SPC are not available to pay Cat Financial’s creditors.  Cat Financial may be obligated to perform under the guarantee if the SPC experiences losses.  No loss has been experienced or is anticipated under this loan purchase agreement.\\xa0Cat Financial has commitments to extend credit to customers and Caterpillar dealers through lines of credit and other pre-approved credit arrangements.  Cat Financial applies the same credit policies and approval process for these commitments to extend credit as we do for other financing.  Collateral is not required for these commitments, but if credit is extended, collateral may be required upon funding.\\xa0\\xa0The amount of unused commitments to extend credit to Caterpillar dealers was $11,154 million at December\\xa031, 2019.  The amount of unused commitments to extend credit to customers was $693 million at December\\xa031, 2019.  A significant portion of these commitments is not expected to be fully drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amounts do not represent a future cash requirement.  Cat Financial generally has the right to unconditionally cancel, alter, or amend the terms of these commitments at any time. \\xa0Our product warranty liability is determined by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory.\\xa0\\xa0Generally, historical claim rates are based on actual warranty experience for each product by machine model/engine size by customer or dealer location (inside or outside North America).\\xa0\\xa0Specific rates are developed for each product shipment month and are updated monthly based on actual warranty claim experience.\\xa0(Millions\\xa0of\\xa0dollars)\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa0Warranty liability, January\\xa01\\xa0$1,391\\xa0$1,419\\xa0Reduction in liability (payments)\\xa0(903)\\xa0(783)\\xa0Increase in liability (new warranties)\\xa01,053\\xa0755\\xa0Warranty liability, December\\xa031\\xa0$1,541\\xa0$1,391\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa022.Environmental and legal mattersThe Company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines. We have made, and will continue to make, significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards.131Table of ContentsWe are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, the investigation, remediation, and operating and maintenance costs are accrued against our earnings. Costs are accrued based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site, including available technologies, current applicable laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, we accrue the minimum. Where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved, we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs. In formulating the estimate of probable costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others. We reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis. The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in Accrued expenses. We believe there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all the sites in the aggregate, will be required.On January 27, 2020, the Brazilian Federal Environmental Agency (“IBAMA”) issued Caterpillar Brasil Ltda a notice of violation regarding allegations around the requirements for use of imported oils at the Piracicaba, Brazil facility.\\xa0 We have instituted processes to address the allegations.\\xa0 While we are still discussing resolution of these allegations with IBAMA, the initial notice from IBAMA included a proposed fine of approximately $370,000.\\xa0 We do not expect this fine or our response to address the allegations to have a material adverse effect on the Company\\'s consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. On January 7, 2015, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois. The subpoena requests documents and information from the Company relating to, among other things, financial information concerning U.S. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries (including undistributed profits of non-U.S. subsidiaries and the movement of cash among U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries). The Company has received additional subpoenas relating to this investigation requesting additional documents and information relating to, among other things, the purchase and resale of replacement parts by Caterpillar Inc. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries, dividend distributions of certain non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries, and Caterpillar SARL (CSARL) and related structures. On March 2-3, 2017, agents with the Department of Commerce, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Internal Revenue Service executed search and seizure warrants at\\xa0three facilities of the Company in the Peoria, Illinois area, including its former corporate headquarters. The warrants identify, and agents seized, documents and information related to, among other things, the export of products from the United States, the movement of products between the United States and Switzerland, the relationship between Caterpillar Inc. and CSARL, and sales outside the United States. It is the Company’s understanding that the warrants, which concern both tax and export activities, are related to the ongoing grand jury investigation. The Company is continuing to cooperate with this investigation. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential loss; however, we currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.On March 20, 2014, Brazil’s Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) published a Technical Opinion which named 18 companies and over 100 individuals as defendants, including two subsidiaries of Caterpillar Inc., MGE - Equipamentos e Serviços Ferroviários Ltda. (MGE) and Caterpillar Brasil Ltda (CBL). The publication of the Technical Opinion opened CADE’s official administrative investigation into allegations that the defendants participated in anticompetitive bid activity for the construction and maintenance of metro and train networks in Brazil. While companies cannot be held criminally liable for anticompetitive conduct in Brazil, criminal charges have been brought against one current employee of MGE and two former employees of MGE involving the same conduct alleged by CADE. On July 8, 2019, CADE found MGE, one of its current employees and two of its former employees liable for anticompetitive conduct. CBL was dismissed from the proceeding without any finding of liability. MGE intends to appeal CADE’s findings. We currently believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.In addition, we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed asbestos and welding fumes exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters, intellectual property rights, taxes (other than income taxes) and securities laws. The aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities, if any, associated with these unresolved legal actions is not material. In some cases, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter. However, we believe there is no more than a remote chance that any liability arising from these matters would be material. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions, we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity. 132Table of Contents23.Segment information\\xa0A.Basis for segment information\\xa0Our Executive Office is comprised of a Chief Executive Officer (CEO), four Group Presidents, a Chief Financial Officer (CFO), a Chief Legal Officer, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary and a Chief Human Resources Officer.

Insurance and risk management products offered include physical damage insurance, inventory protection plans, extended service coverage for machines and engines, and dealer property and casualty insurance. The various forms of financing, insurance and risk management products offered to customers and dealers help support the purchase and lease of our equipment. The segment also earns revenues from ME&T, but the related costs are not allocated to operating segments.\\xa0All Other operating segment:\\xa0 Primarily includes activities such as: business strategy, product management and development, manufacturing and sourcing of filters and fluids, undercarriage, ground-engaging tools, fluid transfer products, precision seals, rubber sealing and connecting components primarily for Cat products; parts distribution; integrated logistics solutions, distribution services responsible for dealer development and administration including a wholly owned dealer in Japan, dealer portfolio management and ensuring the most efficient and effective distribution of machines, engines and parts; and digital investments for new customer and dealer solutions that integrate data analytics with state-of-the-art digital technologies while transforming the buying experience.  Results for the All Other operating segment are included as a reconciling item between reportable segments and consolidated external reporting.\\xa0C.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Segment measurement and reconciliations\\xa0There are several methodology differences between our segment reporting and our external reporting.\\xa0\\xa0The following is a list of the more significant methodology differences:\\xa0•ME&T segment net assets generally include inventories, receivables, property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangibles, accounts payable and customer advances.\\xa0 Beginning in 2019, operating lease right-of-use assets are included in segment assets.  In 2018, the present value of future lease payments for certain ME&T operating leases was included in segment assets while the estimated financing component of the lease payments was excluded.  Liabilities other than accounts payable and customer advances are generally managed at the corporate level and are not included in segment operations.\\xa0 Financial Products Segment assets generally include all categories of assets.\\xa0•Segment inventories and cost of sales are valued using a current cost methodology.•Goodwill allocated to segments is amortized using a fixed amount based on a 20 year useful life.\\xa0 This methodology difference only impacts segment assets; no goodwill amortization expense is included in segment profit.  In addition, only a portion of goodwill for certain acquisitions made in 2011 or later has been allocated to segments.•Currency exposures for ME&T are generally managed at the corporate level and the effects of changes in exchange rates on results of operations within the year are not included in segment profit.\\xa0\\xa0The net difference created in the translation of revenues and costs between exchange rates used for U.S. GAAP reporting and exchange rates used for segment reporting is reported as a methodology difference.•Stock-based compensation expense is not included in segment profit.•Postretirement benefit expenses are split; segments are generally responsible for service costs, with the remaining elements of net periodic benefit cost included as a methodology difference.•ME&T segment profit is determined on a pretax basis and excludes interest expense and most other income/expense items.\\xa0 Financial Products Segment profit is determined on a pretax basis and includes other income/expense items.Reconciling items are created based on accounting differences between segment reporting and our consolidated external reporting. Please refer to pages\\xa0137 to 143 for financial information regarding significant reconciling items.\\xa0\\xa0Most of our reconciling items are self-explanatory given the above explanations.\\xa0\\xa0For the reconciliation of profit, we have grouped the reconciling items as follows:\\xa0•Corporate costs:\\xa0\\xa0These costs are related to corporate requirements primarily for compliance and legal functions for the benefit of the entire organization.134Table of Contents•Restructuring costs:\\xa0\\xa0May include costs for employee separation, long-lived asset impairments and contract terminations. These costs are included in Other operating (income) expenses except for defined-benefit plan curtailment losses and special termination benefits, which are included in Other income (expense).  Restructuring costs also include other exit-related costs which may consist of accelerated depreciation, inventory write-downs, building demolition, equipment relocation and project management costs and LIFO inventory decrement benefits from inventory liquidations at closed facilities,  all of which are primarily included in Cost of goods sold.  Beginning in 2019, only certain restructuring costs are excluded from segment profit.  A table, Reconciliation of Restructuring costs on page 140, has been included to illustrate how segment profit would have been impacted by the restructuring costs.  See Note 25 for more information.•Methodology differences:\\xa0\\xa0See previous discussion of significant accounting differences between segment reporting and consolidated external reporting.•Timing:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Timing differences in the recognition of costs between segment reporting and consolidated external reporting.  For example, certain costs are reported on the cash basis for segment reporting and the accrual basis for consolidated external reporting.135Table of ContentsSegment Information(Millions of

(ECM).  Headquartered in Pistoia, Italy, ECM designs, manufactures, sells and services advanced signal systems for the rail industry.  The ECM acquisition was executed to expand our presence in the international freight and transit industries through a combination of broad product offerings and strong reputation in the signaling market.  The purchase price for the acquisition was $225 million, consisting of $249 million paid at closing, net of $25 million of cash acquired and $1 million of debt assumed. The transaction was financed with available cash.  Tangible assets as of the acquisition date were $109 million, recorded at their fair values, and primarily included cash of $25 million, receivables of $28 million, inventories of $29 million, and property, plant and equipment of $17 million.  Finite-lived intangible assets acquired of $112 million included customer relationships, developed technology and trade names.  The finite lived intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average amortization period of approximately 13 years.  Liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date were $79 million, recorded at their fair values, and primarily included accounts payable of $38 million and net deferred tax liabilities of $29 million.  Goodwill of $109 million, non-deductible for income tax purposes, represented the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represented the estimated future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized.  Factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill include ECM’s strategic fit into our rail product portfolio, the opportunity to provide a complete line-up of signaling and train control systems and the acquired assembled workforce.  The results of the acquired business for the period from the acquisition date are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and reported in the Energy & Transportation segment in Note 23.  Assuming this transaction had been made at the beginning of any period presented, the consolidated pro forma results would not be materially different from reported results.  Downer Freight Rail  On January 2, 2018, we completed the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of the Downer Freight Rail business (Downer Freight Rail).  Headquartered in North Ryde, Australia, Downer Freight Rail provides a full suite of rolling stock, aftermarket parts and services throughout Australia.  The acquisition was executed to strengthen our existing Rail footprint in Australia, which currently includes rolling stock maintenance facilities, as well as infrastructure and signaling facilities.  The purchase price for the acquisition was $97 million.  The transaction was financed with available cash.  Tangible assets as of the acquisition date were $86 million, recorded at their fair values, and primarily included receivables of $23 million, inventories of $40 million, and property, plant and equipment of $15 million.  Finite-lived customer relationship intangible assets acquired were $6 million.  The finite lived intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over an amortization period of 15 years.  Liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date were $14 million, which represented their fair values.  Goodwill of $18 million, not expected to be deducted for income tax purposes, represented the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represented the estimated future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized.  Factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill include Downer Freight Rail’s strategic fit into our rail product portfolio, the opportunity to expand our aftermarket parts and maintenance service portfolio in Australia and the acquired assembled workforce.  The results of the acquired business for the period from the acquisition date are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and reported in the Energy & Transportation segment in Note 23.  Assuming this transaction had been made at the beginning of any period presented, the consolidated pro forma results would not be materially different from reported results. 25.  Restructuring costs\\xa0Our accounting for employee separations is dependent upon how the particular program is designed.  For voluntary programs, eligible separation costs are recognized at the time of employee acceptance unless the acceptance requires explicit approval by the company.  For involuntary programs, eligible costs are recognized when management has approved the program, the affected employees have been properly notified and the costs are estimable.Restructuring costs for 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:144Table of Contents\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0(Millions\\xa0of\\xa0dollars)\\xa02019\\xa02018\\xa02017Employee separations 1\\xa0$48\\xa0$112\\xa0$525Contract terminations 1\\xa01\\xa07\\xa0183Long-lived asset impairments 1\\xa065\\xa093\\xa0346Defined benefit plan curtailments and termination benefits 2\\xa0—\\xa0(8)\\xa029Other 3\\xa0122\\xa0182\\xa0173Total restructuring costs\\xa0$236\\xa0$386\\xa0$1,256\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa01\\xa0Recognized in Other operating (income) expenses.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa02\\xa0Recognized in Other income (expense).3  Represents costs related to our restructuring programs, primarily for project management, inventory write-downs, accelerated depreciation and equipment relocation, and also LIFO inventory decrement benefits from inventory liquidations at closed facilities, all of which are primarily included in Cost of goods sold.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The restructuring costs in 2019 were primarily related to restructuring actions across the company.  The restructuring costs in 2018 were primarily related to ongoing facility closures across the company.  In 2017, about half of the restructuring costs were related to the closure of the facility in Gosselies, Belgium, within Construction Industries, and the remainder was related to other restructuring actions across the company. Certain restructuring costs are a reconciling item between Segment profit and Consolidated profit before taxes. See Note 23 for more information.The following table summarizes the 2018 and 2019 employee separation activity:(Millions\\xa0of\\xa0dollars)\\xa0Liability balance at December\\xa031, 2017$249Increase in liability (separation charges)112Reduction in liability (payments)(276)Liability balance at December\\xa031, 2018$85Increase in liability (separation charges)48Reduction in liability (payments)(85)Liability balance at December\\xa031, 2019$48\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Most of the remaining liability balance as of December 31, 2019 is expected to be paid in 2020. In March 2017, Caterpillar informed Belgian authorities of the decision to proceed to a collective dismissal, which led to the closure of the Gosselies site, impacting about 2,000 employees. Production of Caterpillar products at the Gosselies site ended during the second quarter of 2017. The other operations and functions at the Gosselies site were phased out by the end of the second quarter of 2018.  The program concluded in 2018, and we incurred a total of $647 million of restructuring costs (primarily in 2017) under the program. Those costs were primarily related to employee separation costs, long-lived asset impairments, and other costs which were partially offset by a LIFO inventory decrement benefit. In September 2015, we announced a large scale restructuring plan (the Plan) including a voluntary retirement enhancement program for qualifying U.S. employees, several voluntary separation programs outside of the United States, additional involuntary programs throughout the company and manufacturing facility consolidations and closures.  The largest action among those included in the Plan was related to our European manufacturing footprint which led to the Gosselies, Belgium, facility, closure as discussed above.  We incurred $43 million, $121 million and $817 million of restructuring costs associated with these actions in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  The Plan concluded in 2019,  and total restructuring costs incurred since inception of the Plan were $1,831 million. 145Table of Contents26.
